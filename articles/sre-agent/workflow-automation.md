#customer intent: As an SRE, I want to automate operational workflows so that incidents are handled end-to-end without manual handoffs.

# Workflow automation in Azure SRE Agent
> [!TIP]
> - Handle incidents end-to-end without waking anyone.
> - Run scheduled tasks automatically with human oversight when needed.
> - Apply knowledge from past incidents consistently every time.

## The problem: manual handoffs slow everything down

Operational workflows span multiple tools and require someone to remember what comes next. You check status in one system, make a decision, execute in another, and notify your team in a third. Each handoff adds latency and risk.

## How workflow automation works

By using workflow automation, you can achieve the following goals:

- Create automated workflows that run on schedule or in response to incidents.
- Use subagents with specific tools for specialized tasks.
- Build end-to-end flows that trigger, investigate, act, and notify.

When a trigger fires (scheduled time or incident), your agent follows these steps:

1. **Receives the trigger**: A scheduled task runs or an incident matches a response plan.
1. **Invokes the subagent**: The configured subagent starts with its tools and instructions.
1. **Executes the workflow**: The subagent investigates, takes actions, and coordinates with other subagents if needed.
1. **Notifies your team**: Results are posted to Teams, email, or your incident platform.

Each subagent has access to specific tools (from connectors) and follows its instructions autonomously or with approval, depending on the run mode.

## What makes this different

This section describes how workflow automation compares to other approaches.

**Unlike scripts**, your agent adapts when patterns change. Scripts break when inputs vary. Your agent reasons about what to do based on what it finds.

**Unlike runbooks**, your agent executes the workflow, not just documents it. Runbooks tell humans what to do. Your agent does it.

**Unlike IFTTT-style automation**, your agent investigates before acting. It doesn't blindly execute when a trigger fires. It assesses the situation and decides the appropriate response.

## Before and after

The following table shows how workflow automation changes common operational tasks.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Check status in monitoring tool | Agent queries automatically |
| Decide what to do based on data | Agent reasons and proposes action |
| Execute fix in another system | Agent executes via connected tools |
| Notify team in Slack/Teams | Agent sends contextual notification |
| Log what happened | Agent records actions in thread |

## Build a workflow

Workflows combine three building blocks.

| Building block | What it does | Where to configure |
|---|---|---|
| **Connectors** | Provide tools from external systems (Outlook, Teams, GitHub, PagerDuty) | Builder > Connectors |
| **Subagents** | Specialized workers with specific tool access and autonomy settings | Builder > Subagent builder |
| **Triggers** | Start workflows on schedule or in response to incidents | Builder > Scheduled tasks / Incident response plans |

For step-by-step setup, see [Step 5: Automate Actions](automate-actions.md) in the getting started guide.

## Example: daily health report with email

This workflow checks Azure resource health and emails a summary.

1. **Connector**: Add **Send email (Office 365 Outlook)**.
1. **Subagent**: Create `health-reporter` with the `SendOutlookEmail` tool.
1. **Scheduled task**: Attach to subagent with this prompt:

    ```text
    Check the health of Azure resources in prod-rg:
    1. Query Azure Resource Health for any degraded resources
    2. Check Application Insights for error rate trends
    3. Summarize findings
    4. Email the report using SendOutlookEmail
    ```

The agent runs this daily, investigates, and sends the email with no manual steps.

## Subagent delegation

Use multiple subagents when a workflow needs different expertise at different steps.

| Step | Subagent | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Database diagnostics | @DatabaseExpert | Specialized KQL queries |
| Send notifications | @Notifier | Email and Teams tools |
| Create incidents | @IncidentCreator | PagerDuty/ServiceNow integration |

The orchestrator delegates tasks to subagents as needed. For more information, see [Subagents](sub-agents.md).

## Best practices

The following table summarizes recommended practices for workflow automation.

| Practice | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Test in the Playground first** | Verify your subagent's behavior before attaching to a trigger |
| **Start in Review mode** | Verify the agent's judgment before full automation |
| **Test with "Run task now"** | Validate scheduled workflows before production |
| **One tool per subagent** | Easier to audit, debug, and update |
| **Use descriptive names** | `email-health-report` vs `subagent-1` |

> [!TIP]
> **Test subagents in the Playground**
>
> Before attaching a scheduled task, test your subagent:
>
> 1. Go to **Builder** > **Subagent builder**.
> 1. Select **Test playground** view.
> 1. Pick a subagent from the dropdown and select **Apply**.
> 1. Type your planned instructions in the Test panel and verify the agent executes them correctly.
>
> Once you're confident in the behavior, attach the trigger.
