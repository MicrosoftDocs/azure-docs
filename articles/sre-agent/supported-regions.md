# Supported regions for Azure SRE Agent

Azure SRE Agent is available in select Azure regions. This reference lists the currently supported regions and provides guidance on choosing a region for your agent.

## Available regions

The following table lists the Azure regions where you can deploy Azure SRE Agent.

| Region | Canonical name | Geographic area |
|---|---|---|
| East US 2 | `eastus2` | United States |
| Sweden Central | `swedencentral` | Europe |
| Australia East | `australiaeast` | Asia Pacific |

## Check your available regions

To see which regions are available for your subscription, follow these steps:

1. Go to [sre.azure.com](https://sre.azure.com).
1. Select **Create agent**.
1. Choose your **Subscription** from the dropdown.
1. Open the **Region** dropdown.

The dropdown displays all regions available for your subscription.

### No regions appear

If the **Region** dropdown is empty, you're not registered for Azure SRE Agent. [Submit a registration request](https://github.com/microsoft/sre-agent/issues/new?labels=registration&title=Subscription+registration+request) with your subscription ID.

## Region selection guidance

Use the following recommendations when you choose a region for your agent.

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Data residency requirements | Choose a region in your required geography. |
| Cross-region resources | Your agent can access resources in any region where you grant permissions. The agent region only determines where the agent compute runs. |

> [!NOTE]
>Your agent deploys to a single region in a single subscription. However, with appropriate permissions on its managed identity, the agent can manage resources across any region or subscription in your Azure environment.

## Frequently asked questions

This section answers common questions about Azure SRE Agent region support.

### Can I deploy agents to multiple regions?

Each agent is deployed to a single region. To operate in multiple regions, create a separate agent in each region.

### Can I change an agent's region after creation?

No. You set the region during agent creation and can't change it afterward. Create a new agent to use a different region.

### Can I request a new region?

Yes. [Submit a new region request](https://github.com/microsoft/sre-agent/issues/new?labels=region-request&title=New+region+request) with the region you need and your use case.
