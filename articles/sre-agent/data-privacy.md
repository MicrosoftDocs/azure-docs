# Data residency and privacy in Azure SRE Agent (preview)

The following data residency and privacy policies are in effect for Azure SRE Agent while in preview.

By using an SRE Agent, you consent to the product-specific [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Agent location

During preview, you can only choose to create Azure SRE Agent in the *Sweden Central*, *East US 2*, and *Australia East* regions.

## Data residency

- All content and conversation history with the SRE Agent is transferred to and stored in the agent's Azure region. Data includes prompts, responses, and resource analysis.  

- All data is transferred to the agent's Azure region, regardless of the Azure region of origin of services the agent manages.

- Data is processed and stored within the agentâ€™s region as selected at time of creation.

## Privacy

- Microsoft doesn't use your data to train AI models.

- Your data is only used to provide the functionality of the service and to improve and debug the service as needed.

- Data is isolated using tenant and Azure subscription boundaries.
