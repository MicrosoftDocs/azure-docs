# Configure permissions modes in Azure SRE Agent (preview)

Azure SRE Agent allows you to decide if you want the agent to act on its own (*autonomous mode*), or with your input (*review mode*).

When working in review mode, the agent requires your approval for every action or write operation it performs. In autonomous mode, the agent performs these actions on your behalf, without stopping for explicit approval.

## Permission requirements

When working with Azure SRE Agent permissions, consider the following key points:

### Prerequisites for provisioning

When provisioning the SRE Agent, you must have either the **Owner** or **User Access Administrator** built-in role, or a custom role with equivalent permissions. This requirement allows you to assign resource groups to the agent, even if you don't have permissions to perform all operations on the resources being managed.

### Managing resource groups

You can add or remove resource groups from the agent to control its scope of operation:

- **Adding resource groups** grants the agent permissions to the resources within those groups

- **Removing resource groups** revokes the agent's access to those resources

## Agent behavior based on permission mode

The following table summarizes how the agent behaves based on its operational mode and available permissions:

| Mode | Identity has permissions | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Review | Yes  | If given approval from a human reviewer, the agent executes commands related to the action. |
| Review | No  | If given approval from a human reviewer, the agent responds with a chance to grant the necessary permissions to the agent, use the reviewer's permissions, or return manual instructions on how to achieve the action. |
| Autonomous | Yes | The agent performs actions using the agent identity.  |
| Autonomous | No | The agent is forced to prompt for approval from a reviewer. If granted approval, then the agent responds with a chance for the reviewer to grant the agent the necessary permissions, use the reviewer's permissions, or return manual instructions on how to achieve the action.  |

> [!NOTE]
> You can't directly remove specific permissions from the agent. To restrict the agent's access, you must remove the entire resource group from the agent's scope.
