# Memory and knowledge in Azure SRE Agent
<!-- > [!VIDEO <PATH_TO_VIDEO>/Agent_s_Perfect_Memory.mp4] -->

Your agent becomes more effective over time by remembering what worked in past incidents and referencing your documentation.

## How memory works

When you ask a question, your agent searches across all knowledge sources simultaneously.

| Source | What it finds | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Past incidents** | Steps that resolved similar problems | "How did we fix this before?" |
| **User memories** | Facts you explicitly save | "Remember my environment uses..." |
| **Knowledge base** | Your uploaded runbooks and docs | "Follow our standard procedure" |

The agent returns a grounded response with **clickable citations** that show exactly where the information came from.

## Automatic learning

Your agent learns from every conversation. No manual training is required.

:::image type="content" source="media/memory/memory-auto-learning.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing the agent automatically extracting learnings after each session: symptoms, resolution steps, root cause, and pitfalls to avoid." lightbox="media/memory/memory-auto-learning.svg":::

After each thread completes, the agent captures the following information.

| What | Description |
|---|---|
| **Symptoms observed** | Error messages, behaviors, patterns |
| **Steps that worked** | The resolution path that succeeded |
| **Root cause** | What caused the issue |
| **Pitfalls to avoid** | What didn't work, dead ends |

This process happens automatically. Thirty minutes after a thread goes quiet, the agent evaluates the conversation and indexes the learnings.

### Same-resource priority

When investigating a resource issue, the agent prioritizes past sessions on the **exact same resource**.

```text
"App Service app-prod-01 is returning 503 errors"
```

Your agent first checks whether it saw problems on `app-prod-01` before. If yes, those learnings appear first because they have the highest relevance.

## Proactive knowledge persistence

Beyond learning from completed threads, your agent actively saves what it discovers during conversations. When your agent encounters something important (a tricky configuration, a non-obvious dependency, or a debugging gotcha), it records the insight in persistent knowledge files that carry across sessions.

### How it works

Your agent keeps a knowledge directory at `memories/synthesizedKnowledge/`. The agent automatically loads a special file, `overview.md`, into the system prompt at the start of every conversation. This approach gives your agent immediate access to the most important context about your environment.

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`overview.md`** | Service summary and index. Always loaded into context (~2,000 character budget). |
| **Topic files** | Detailed notes on specific subjects (for example, `aks-networking-gotchas.md`). |
| **Links from overview** | `overview.md` links to topic files so your agent knows what detailed knowledge exists. |

### What your agent saves

Your agent proactively records insights during conversations.

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Problem constraints** | "This service can't scale past 10 replicas due to quota limits" |
| **Strategies that worked** | "Restarting the pod with `--grace-period=0` resolved the stuck deployment" |
| **Strategies that failed** | "Increasing memory limit didn't help. The issue was CPU throttling" |
| **Non-obvious dependencies** | "app-frontend depends on a sidecar proxy that must start first" |
| **Configuration details** | "Production uses custom TLS certificates stored in Key Vault" |

### Knowledge organization

Your agent organizes knowledge **semantically by topic**, not chronologically. Each file is a self-contained reference.

| File | What it captures |
|---|---|
| `overview.md` | Service summary, key links, index of topic files (~2,000 chars) |
| `team.md` | Team members, roles, expertise (~500 chars) |
| `architecture.md` | Components, connections, environments (~1,500 chars) |
| `logs.md` | Log sources, tables, key fields, useful queries (~1,500 chars) |
| `deployment.md` | Pipeline details, version lookup, rollback procedures (~1,000 chars) |
| `auth.md` | Auth mechanisms, identity flows (~800 chars) |
| `debugging.md` | Common issues, troubleshooting guides, runbook links (~1,000 chars) |
| `queries/*.md` | Extracted queries organized by topic (~1,000 chars each) |

When updating existing knowledge, your agent reads the current file, merges new information, and removes anything that becomes outdated or incorrect.

> [!TIP]
> **You can ask your agent to save knowledge too**
>
> Beyond automatic persistence, you can explicitly ask your agent to save information to its knowledge files:
>
> ```text
> Save this to your knowledge: our Redis cache uses Premium tier with 6GB,
> and failover takes about 90 seconds.
> ```
>
> Your agent creates or updates the appropriate knowledge file and links it from `overview.md`.
>
> This approach is different from `#remember` commands (described in the next section), which save discrete facts to a separate memory store. Knowledge files are structured, persistent references that your agent consults at the start of every conversation. User memories are individual facts searchable via `#retrieve`.

## User memories

Beyond what your agent learns and persists automatically, you can explicitly save discrete facts for your agent to remember. User memories are ideal for environment-specific details that might not come up in incidents but are important for context.

The following table describes good candidates for user memories.

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Environment facts** | "Production uses three AKS clusters in West US 2" |
| **Team preferences** | "We prefer CLI over portal for deployments" |
| **Architecture details** | "app-service-01 depends on sql-prod" |
| **Escalation paths** | "PagerDuty, then Teams channel, then phone" |

### Memory commands

Manage user memories by using these chat commands.

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `#remember` | Save a fact for future reference | `#remember our Redis cache uses Premium tier` |
| `#retrieve` | Search your saved memories | `#retrieve what's our caching setup?` |
| `#forget` | Remove a saved memory | `#forget the outdated Redis info` |

The following example shows a typical memory workflow.

**Save important context:**

```text
#remember Production uses 3 AKS clusters in West US 2
#remember Our escalation path: PagerDuty, then Teams channel, then phone
#remember Database failover takes approximately 15 minutes
```

**Retrieve later:**

```text
#retrieve how long does database failover take?
```

The agent responds based on the saved memory: "Database failover takes approximately 15 minutes."

## Knowledge base

Upload your documentation and connect external sources to give your agent a broader reference library.

:::image type="content" source="media/memory/knowledge-sources.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing knowledge coming from uploaded documents and MCP connectors, all searchable together.":::

### Upload documents

Go to **Builder > Knowledge base** to upload your documentation.

| Document type | Good for |
|---|---|
| Runbooks | Step-by-step incident procedures |
| Architecture guides | Understanding your environment |
| On-call playbooks | Escalation and response procedures |
| API documentation | Service-specific knowledge |
| Team procedures | Workflow and process docs |

**Supported formats:** Markdown (`.md`), Plain text (`.txt`). Maximum file size is 16 MB.

### Connect external sources

Access knowledge directly from external systems by using [connectors](connectors.md).

| Connector | What it provides |
|---|---|
| **Azure DevOps** | Query your ADO wiki pages |
| **GitHub** | Search repos, wikis, issues |
| **Microsoft Learn** | Official Microsoft documentation |
| **Custom MCP** | Any knowledge source you configure |

Configure connectors in **Settings > Connectors**. For more information, see [Connectors](connectors.md).

## Use knowledge in conversations

Your agent automatically searches knowledge when it's relevant to the question.

```text
How should I handle a database failover?
```

If you upload a runbook, the agent responds with a grounded answer:

> Based on your **Database Runbook** *(citation link)*, here are the failover steps:
> 1. Verify the health of the secondary replica...

Select the citation links to view the full source document.

## Session insights

After every thread (a synchronous chat conversation or an asynchronous autotriggered task), your agent generates a **session insight**. Session insights are how your agent gets smarter over time.

### What gets captured

Each session insight extracts structured learnings that become searchable memory.

| Component | What it captures | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Symptoms observed** | Error patterns, behaviors | "HTTP 503 errors, memory at 95%" |
| **Resolution steps** | What worked | "Scaled up App Service SKU" |
| **Root cause** | Why it happened | "Memory leak in deployment v2.3" |
| **Pitfalls to avoid** | What didn't work | "Restarting didn't help" |

### When insights are generated

The following table describes when session insights are generated.

| Thread type | When | Auto or manual |
|---|---|---|
| **Sync chat** | 30 minutes after last message | Automatic |
| **Async tasks** | 30 minutes after completion | Automatic |
| **User feedback** | When you rate a response | You trigger it |

### View session insights

Go to **Monitor > Session insights** to see:

- Timeline of agent actions
- Evaluation scores
- Key learnings extracted
- **Source thread links**: each insight card links back to the threads that generated it, so you can trace any insight to its original conversation

For detailed metrics and management, see [Monitor agent usage](monitor-agent-usage.md).

## Best practices

Follow these recommendations to get the most value from your agent's memory and knowledge capabilities.

### Choose what to upload vs. connect

| Upload | Connect via connector |
|---|---|
| Incident runbooks | Live wiki pages (ADO, GitHub) |
| Architecture diagrams | Source code repositories |
| Escalation procedures | Real-time monitoring data |
| Static API docs | Frequently updated docs |

### Keep knowledge current

Outdated documents cause incorrect responses. Review your knowledge base quarterly. To see what documents your agent currently has, ask:

```text
What knowledge documents do you have?
```

Remove outdated documents in **Builder > Knowledge base**.

### Name documents clearly

Use descriptive file names to help your agent and your team find the right documentation quickly.

| Don't use | Use instead |
|---|---|
| doc1.txt | production-database-failover.md |
| runbook.md | aks-cluster-scaling-runbook.md |
| notes.txt | escalation-procedures-2026.txt |
