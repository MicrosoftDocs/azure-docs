# Azure Storage Mover scale and performance targets

The performance of a storage migration service is a key aspect for any migration. In this article, we share performance test results, though because Azure Storage Mover is a new service, your experience might vary.

## Scale targets

Azure Storage Mover is tested with 500 million namespace items (files and folders), migrated from a [supported source to a supported target](service-overview.md#supported-sources-and-targets) in Azure.

## How we test

Azure Storage Mover is a hybrid cloud service. Hybrid services have a cloud service component and an infrastructure component the administrator of the service runs in their corporate environment. For Storage Mover, that hybrid component is a migration agent. Agents are virtual machines, ran on a host near the source storage. 

:::image type="content" source="media/across-articles/data-vs-management-path.png" alt-text="A diagram illustrating a migration's path by showing two arrows. The first arrow represents data traveling to a storage account from the source or agent and a second arrow represents only the management or control info to the storage mover resource or service." lightbox="media/across-articles/data-vs-management-path-large.png":::

Only the agent is a relevant part of the service for performance testing. To omit privacy and performance concerns, data travels directly from the Storage Mover agent to the target storage in Azure. Only control and telemetry messages are sent to the cloud service.

## Performance baselines

These test results are created under ideal conditions. They're meant as a baseline of the components the Storage Mover service and agent can directly influence. Differences in source devices, disks, and network connections aren't considered in this test. Real-world performance varies.

### [SMB Mount : Azure file share](#tab/smb)

Migration from SMB mount to Azure file share tests were executed as follows:

The following table describes the characteristics of the test environments that produced the performance test results from an SMB mount to an Azure file share.

## Why migration performance varies

Fundamentally, network quality and the ability to process files, folders, and their metadata affect your migration velocity.

Across the two core areas of network and compute, several aspects have an impact:

- **Migration scenario** <br />Copying into an empty target is faster as compared to a target with content. This behavior is due the migration engine evaluating not only the source, but also the target to make copy decisions.
- **Namespace item count** <br />Migrating 1 GiB of small files takes more time than migrating 1 GiB of larger files.
- **Namespace shape** <br />A wide folder hierarchy lends itself to more parallel processing than a narrow or deep directory structure. The file to folder ratio also plays a roll.
- **Namespace churn**  <br />How many files, folders, and metadata change between two copy runs from the same source to the same target. 
- **Network**
    - bandwidth and latency between source and migration agent
    - bandwidth and latency between migration agent and the target in Azure
- **Migration agent resources** <br />The amount of memory (RAM), number of compute cores, and even the amount of available, local disk capacity on the migration agent can have a profound impact on the migration velocity. More compute resources help to optimize the utilization of the available bandwidth, especially when large amounts of smaller files need to be processed in a migration.

For example, a traditional migration requires a strategy to minimize downtime of the workload that depends on the storage that is to be migrated. Azure Storage Mover supports this strategy, referred to as *convergent, n-pass migration*.

In this strategy, you copy from source to target several times. During these copy iterations, the source remains available for read and write to the workload. Just before the final copy iteration, you take the source offline. The final copy is expected to finish faster than the first copy you make, and take about as long as the one immediately preceding it. After the final copy, the workload is failed over to use the new target storage in Azure and available for use again.

During the first copy from source to target, the target is likely empty and all the source content must travel to the target. As a result, the first copy is likely most constrained by the available network resources. 

Towards the end of a migration, after you copy the source to the target several times already, only a few files, folders, and metadata are modified following the last copy. In this last copy iteration, comparing each file in source and target to see if it needs to be updated, requires more compute resources and fewer network resources. Copy runs in this late stage of a migration are often more compute-constrained. Proper [resourcing of the Storage Mover agent](agent-deploy.md#recommended-compute-and-memory-resources) becomes increasingly important.
