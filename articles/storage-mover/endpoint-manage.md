# Manage Azure Storage Mover endpoints

While the term *endpoint* is often used in networking, it's used in the context of the Storage Mover service to describe a storage location with a high level of detail.

A storage mover endpoint is a resource that contains the path to either a source or destination location and other relevant information. Endpoints are used in the creation of a job definition to define the source and target locations for a particular copy operation. Only certain types of endpoints can be used as a source or a target, respectively. For example, data contained within an NFS (Network File System) file share endpoint can only be copied to a blob storage container. Similarly, copy operations  with an SMB-based (Server Message Block) file share target can only be migrated to an Azure file share,

This article guides you through the creation and management of Azure Storage Mover endpoints. To follow these examples, you need a top-level storage mover resource. If you haven't created one, follow the steps within the [Create a Storage Mover resource](storage-mover-create.md) article before continuing.

After you complete the steps within this article, you'll be able to create and manage endpoints using the Azure portal and Azure PowerShell.

## Endpoint resource overview

Within the Azure Storage Mover resource hierarchy, a migration project is used to organize migration jobs into logical tasks or components. A migration project in turn contains at least one job definition, which describes both the source and target locations for your migration project. The [Understanding the Storage Mover resource hierarchy](resource-hierarchy.md) article contains more detailed information about the relationships between a Storage Mover, its endpoints, and its projects.

Because a migration requires both a well-defined source and target, endpoints are parented to the top-level storage mover resource. This placement allows you to reuse endpoints across any number of job definitions. While only a single endpoint resource exists, the properties of each individual endpoint might vary based on its type. For example, NFS (Network File System) shares, SMB  shares, and Azure Storage blob container endpoints each require fundamentally different information.

[!INCLUDE [protocol-endpoint-agent](includes/protocol-endpoint-agent.md)]

### SMB endpoints

 SMB uses the ACL (access control list) concept and user-based authentication to provide access to shared files for selected users. To maintain security, Storage Mover relies on Azure Key Vault integration to securely store and tightly control access to user credentials and other secrets. During a migration, storage mover agent resources  connect to your SMB endpoints with Key Vault secrets rather than with unsecure hard-coded credentials. This approach greatly reduces the chance that secrets might be accidentally leaked.

After your local file share source is configured, add secrets for both a username and a password to your Key Vault. You need to supply both your Key Vault's name or Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), and the names or URIs of the credential secrets when creating your SMB endpoints.

Agent access to both your Key Vault and target storage resources is controlled through the Azure RBAC (role-based access control) authorization system. This system allows you to define access based on attributes associated with managed identities, security principals, and resources. It's important to note that the required RBAC role assignments are automatically applied when SMB endpoints are created within the Azure portal. However, any endpoint created programmatically requires you to make the following assignments manually:

|Role                                        |Resource                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|*Key Vault Secrets User*                    | The Key Vault resource used to store your SMB source's credential  |
|*Storage File Data Privileged Contributor*  | Your target file share resource                                    |

There are many use cases that require preserving metadata values such as file and folder timestamps, ACLs, and file attributes. Storage Mover supports the same level of file fidelity as the underlying Azure file share. Azure Files in turn [supports a subset](/rest/api/storageservices/set-file-properties) of the [NTFS file properties](/windows/win32/fileio/file-attribute-constants). The following table represents common metadata that is migrated:

|Metadata property      |Outcome                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Directory structure    |The original directory structure of the source is preserved on the target share.          |
|Access permissions     |Permissions on the source file or directory are preserved on the target share.            |
|Symbolic links         |Symbolic links on the source are preserved and mapped on the target share.                |
|Create timestamp       |The original create timestamp of the source file is preserved on the target share.        |
|Change timestamp       |The original change timestamp of the source file is preserved on the target share.        |
|Modified timestamp     |The original modified timestamp of the source file is preserved on the target share.      |
|Last access timestamp  |This last access timestamp isn't supported for a file or directory on the target share.   |
|Other metadata         |Other metadata of the source item is preserved if the target share is supporting it.      |

### NFS endpoints

Using the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux or UNIX. The current Azure Storage Mover release supports migrations from NFS shares on a NAS or server device within your network to an Azure blob container only.

Unlike SMB, NFS doesn't utilize the ACL concept or user-based authentication. This difference allows NFS endpoints to be accessed without Azure Key Vault integration. In addition, Storage Mover processes metadata differently for both NFS mount sources and their blob container target counterparts. The following table identifies outcomes for common metadata encountered during migration:

|Metadata property      |Outcome                                                                              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Directory structure    |Blob containers don't have a traditional file system, but instead support "virtual folders." The path of a file within a folder is prepended to the file name and placed in a flat list within the blob container. Empty folders are represented as an empty blob in the target container. As with files, the source folder's metadata is persisted in the custom metadata field of this blob.|
|Access permissions     |Permissions on the source file are preserved in custom blob metadata but don't work as they did within the source.|
|Symbolic links         |A target file is migrated if its symbolic link can be resolved. A symbolic link that can't be resolved is logged as a failed file.|
|Create timestamp       |The original timestamp of the source file is preserved as custom blob metadata. The blob-native timestamp reflects the time at which the file was migrated.|
|Change timestamp       |The original timestamp of the source file is preserved as custom blob metadata. There's no blob-native timestamp of this type.|
|Modified timestamp     |The original timestamp of the source file is preserved as custom blob metadata. The blob-native timestamp reflects the time at which the file was migrated.|
|Last accessed timestamp|This timestamp is preserved as custom blob metadata if it exists on the source file. There's no blob-native timestamp of this type.|
|Other metadata         |Other metadata is persisted in a custom metadata field of the target blob if it exists on source items. Only 4 KiB of metadata can be stored. Metadata of a larger size isn't migrated.|

## Create an endpoint

Before you can create a job definition, you need to create endpoints for your source and target data sources.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not yet deployed a Storage Mover resource using the resource provider, you'll need to create your top level resource before attempting the steps in this example.

Azure Storage Mover supports migration scenarios using NFS and SMB protocols. The steps to create both endpoints are similar. The key differentiator between the creation of NFS- and SMB-enabled endpoints is the use of Azure Key Vault to store the shared credential for SMB resources. When a migration job is run, the agents use the shared credential stored within Key Vault. Access to Key Vault secrets are managed by granting an RBAC role assignment to the agent's managed identity.

### Create a source endpoint

Source endpoints identify locations from which your data is migrated. Source endpoints are used to define the origin the data specified within your migration project. Azure Storage Mover handles source locations in the form of file shares. These locations might reside on Network Attached Storage (NAS), a server, or even on a workstation. Common protocols for file shares are SMB (Server Message Block) and NFS (Network File System).

The following steps describe the process of creating a source endpoint.

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

   1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **Storage mover** resource page. Select **Storage endpoints** from within the navigation pane to access your endpoints.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/storage-mover.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Storage Mover resource page within the Azure portal showing the location of the Storage Endpoints link." lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/storage-mover-lrg.png":::

      On the **Storage endpoints** page, the default **Storage endpoints** view displays the names of any provisioned source endpoints and a summary of their associated properties. You can select **Target endpoints** to view the corresponding destination endpoints. You can also filter the results further by selecting either the **Protocol version** or **Host** filter and selecting the appropriate option.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Storage Endpoints page within the Azure portal showing the location of the endpoint filters." lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-filter-lrg.png":::

   1. Select **Create endpoint** to expand the **Endpoint type** menu. Select **Create source endpoint** to open the **Create source endpoint** pane as shown in the following image.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-source-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Endpoint Overview page highlighting the location of the Create Endpoint link." lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-source-create-lrg.png":::

   1. Within the **Create source endpoint** pane, provide values for the required **Host name or IP** and **Share name** values. The host name or IP address value must be either an IPv4 address, or fully qualified domain or host name.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Depending on your DNS configuration, you may need to use your fully qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of your hostname.

       You can also add an optional **Description** value of up to 1024 characters in length. Next, select **Protocol version** to expand the protocol selection menu and select the appropriate option for your source target.

      Storage mover agents use secrets stored within Key Vault to connect to SMB endpoints. When you create an SMB source endpoint, you need to provide both the name of the Key Vault containing the secrets and the names of the secrets themselves.

      First, select **Key vault** to expand the menu and select the name of the Key Vault containing your secrets. You can supply a value with which to filter the list of Key Vaults if necessary.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/key-vault.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create Source pane showing the drop-down list containing a resource group's Key Vaults.":::

      After you select the appropriate Key Vault, you can supply values for the required **Select secret for username** and **Select secret for password** fields. These values can be supplied by providing the URI to the secrets, or by selecting the secrets from a list. Select the **Select secret** button to enable the menu and select the username and password values. Alternatively, you can enable the **Enter secret from URI** option and supply the appropriate URI to the username and password secret.

      The values for host and share name are concatenated to form the full migration source path. The path value is displayed in the **Full source path** field. Copy the path provided and verify that you're able to access it before committing your changes. Finally, after confirming that all values are correct and that you can access the source path, select **Create** to add your new endpoint.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/secrets.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create Endpoint pane showing the location of the Secrets options."  lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/secrets-lrg.png":::

      Your new endpoint is deployed and now appears within the list of source endpoints as shown in the following sample image.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-added.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Endpoint Overview page with the newly created endpoint displayed."  lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-added-lrg.png":::

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

   The `New-AzStorageMoverSmbEndpoint` and `New-AzStorageMoverNfsEndpoint` cmdlets are used to create a new endpoint within a [storage mover resource](storage-mover-create.md) you previously deployed.

   If you haven't installed the `Az.StorageMover` module:

   ```powershell
   ## Ensure you are running the latest version of PowerShell 7
   $PSVersionTable.PSVersion

   ## Your local execution policy must be set to at least remote signed or less restrictive
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

   ## If you don't have the general Az PowerShell module, install it first
   Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force

   ## Lastly, the Az.StorageMover module is not installed by default and must be manually requested.
   Install-Module -Name Az.StorageMover -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
   ```

   See the [Install Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) article for more help installing Azure PowerShell.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Renaming endpoint resources is not supported. It's a good idea to ensure that you've named the project appropriately since you won't be able to change much of the endpoint name after it is provisioned. You may, however, choose to create a new endpoint with the same properties and a different name as shown in a later section. Refer to the [resource naming convention](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules.md#microsoftstoragesync) to choose a supported name.

   1. It's always a good idea to create and use variables to store lengthy or potentially complex strings. 

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Depending on your DNS configuration, you may need to use your fully qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of your hostname.

      Copy the sample code block and supply values for the required parameters. The `-Description` parameter is optional and is added in the [View and edit an endpoint's properties](#view-and-edit-an-endpoints-properties) section.

      ```powershell
      
      ## Set variables
      $subscriptionID    = "[Subscription GUID]"
      $resourceGroupName = "[Resource group name]"
      $storageMoverName  = "[Storage mover resource's name]"
      $sourceHost        = "[Source share's host name or IP address]"
      $sourceShare       = "[Source share's name]"
      $targetResourceID  = "/subscriptions/[GUID]/resourceGroups/demoResourceGroup/"
      $targetResourceID += "providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/demoAccount"

      ## For SMB endpoints 
      $smbFileshare      = "[Target fileshare name]"
      $usernameURI       = "https://demo.vault.azure.net/secrets/demoUser"
      $passwordURI       = "https://demo.vault.azure.net/secrets/demoPassword"

      ## For NFS endpoints
      $nfsContainer      = "[Blob container target]"
      
      ```

   1. Connect to your Azure account by using the `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet. Specify the ID for your subscription by providing a value for the `-Subscription` parameter as shown in the example.

      ```powershell
      
      Connect-AzAccount -Subscription $subscriptionID
      
      ```

   1. After you've successfully connected, you can create new source endpoint resources. Depending on your requirement, you can use the `New-AzStorageMoverSmbEndpoint` cmdlet to create an SMB endpoint as shown in the following example.

      ```powershell

      New-AzStorageMoverSmbEndpoint `
         -Name "smbSourceEndpoint"
         -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
         -StorageMoverName $storageMoverName `
         -Host $sourceHost ` 
         -ShareName $sourceShare `
         -CredentialsUsernameUri $usernameURI `
         -CredentialsPasswordUri $passwordURI
       
      ```

      Alternatively, you can create new NFS source endpoint by using the `New-AzStorageMoverNfsEndpoint` cmdlet as shown.

      ```powershell

      New-AzStorageMoverNfsEndpoint `
          -Name "nfsSourceEndpoint" `
          -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
          -StorageMoverName $storageMoverName `
          -Host $sourceHost `
          -Export $sourceShare `
       
      ```

      The following sample response contains the `ProvisioningState` property, which indicates that the endpoint was successfully created.

      ```Response

      Id                           : /subscriptions/<GUID>/resourceGroups/
                                    demoResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.StorageMover/
                                    storageMovers/demoMover/endpoints/smbTargetEndpoint
      Name                         : demoTarget
      Property                     : {
                                       "endpointType": "AzureStorageSmbFileShare",
                                       "description": "",
                                       "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
                                       "storageAccountResourceId": "/subscriptions/[GUID]/
                                        resourceGroups/demoResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/
                                        storageAccounts/contosoeuap",
                                       "fileShareName": "demoFileshare"
                                     }
      SystemDataCreatedAt          : 6/22/2023 1:19:00 AM
      SystemDataCreatedBy          : user@contoso.com
      SystemDataCreatedByType      : User

      SystemDataLastModifiedBy     : user@contoso.com
      SystemDataLastModifiedByType : User
      Type                         : microsoft.storagemover/storagemovers/endpoints

      ```

### Create a target endpoint

Target endpoints identify locations to which your data is migrated. Azure offers various types of cloud storage. A fundamental aspect of file migrations to Azure is determining which Azure storage option is right for your data. The number of files and folders, their directory structure, access protocol, file fidelity and other aspects are important inputs into a complete cloud solution design.

If you need help with choosing the right Azure target storage for your cloud solution design, refer to the [Cloud migration basics](migration-basics.md) article.

The following steps describe the process of creating a target endpoint.

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

   1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **Storage mover** resource page. Select **Storage endpoints** from within the navigation pane to access your endpoints.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/storage-mover.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Storage Mover resource page within the Azure portal showing the location of the Storage Endpoints links." lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/storage-mover-lrg.png":::

      On the **Storage endpoints** page, the default **Storage endpoints** view displays the names of any provisioned source endpoints and a summary of their associated properties. Select **Target endpoints** to view the existing destination endpoints. You can filter the results further by selecting the **Storage account** filter and the appropriate option.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-target-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Storage Endpoints page within the Azure portal showing the location of the target endpoint filters." lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-target-filter-lrg.png":::

   1. Select **Create endpoint** to expand the **Endpoint type** menu. Select **Create target endpoint** to open the **Create target endpoint** pane as shown in the following image.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-target-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Endpoint Overview page highlighting the location of the Create Endpoint list." lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-target-pane-lrg.png":::

   1. Within the **Create target endpoint** pane, select your subscription and destination storage account from within the **Subscription** and **Storage account** lists, respectively. Next, select the appropriate **Target type** option corresponding to your target endpoint.

      [!INCLUDE [protocol-endpoint-agent](includes/protocol-endpoint-agent.md)]

      Depending on the target type you choose, select either your **Blob container** or your **File share** from the corresponding drop-down list. Finally, you can add an optional **Description** value for your target of up to 1024 characters in length and select **Create** to deploy your endpoint.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-target-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create Endpoint pane showing the location of the required fields and Create button."  lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-target-create-lrg.png":::

   Your new endpoint is deployed and now appears within your list of endpoints as shown in the following example image.

   :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-added.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Endpoint Overview page with the newly created endpoint displayed."  lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-added-lrg.png":::

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

   1. To create a new SMB fileshare, use the `New-AzStorageMoverAzStorageSmbFileShareEndpoint` cmdlet as shown in the following example.

   ```powershell

   New-AzStorageMoverAzStorageSmbFileShareEndpoint `
      -Name "smbTargetEndpoint" ` 
      -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
      -StorageMoverName $storageMoverName ` 
      -StorageAccountResourceId $targetResourceID `
      -FileShareName $targetFileshare

   ```

   Use the `New-AzStorageMoverAzStorageContainerEndpoint` PowerShell cmdlet to create a new NFS blob container. The following example provides provisioning guidance.

   ```powershell

   New-AzStorageMoverAzStorageContainerEndpoint `
     -Name "nfsTargetEndpoint" `
     -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
     -StorageMoverName $storageMoverName `
     -BlobContainerName $targetEpContainer `
     -StorageAccountResourceId $targetResourceID `

   ```

   The following sample response contains the `ProvisioningState` property, which indicates that the endpoint was successfully created.

   ```Response

   Id                           : /subscriptions/<GUID>/resourceGroups/
                                 demoResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.StorageMover/
                                 storageMovers/demoMover/endpoints/smbTargetEndpoint
   Name                         : demoTarget
   Property                     : {
                                    "endpointType": "AzureStorageSmbFileShare",
                                    "description": "",
                                    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
                                    "storageAccountResourceId": "/subscriptions/[GUID]/
                                     resourceGroups/demoResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/
                                     storageAccounts/contosoeuap",
                                    "fileShareName": "demoFileshare"
                                  }
   SystemDataCreatedAt          : 6/22/2023 1:19:00 AM
   SystemDataCreatedBy          : user@contoso.com
   SystemDataCreatedByType      : User
   SystemDataLastModifiedAt     : 6/22/2023 1:19:00 AM

## View and edit an endpoint's properties

Depending on your use case, you might need to retrieve either a specific endpoint, or a complete list of all your endpoint resources. You might also need to add or edit an endpoint's description.

Follow the steps in this section to view endpoints accessible to your Storage Mover resource.

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

   1. To create an endpoint using the Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the **Storage mover** resource page. Select **Storage endpoints** from within the navigation pane to access your endpoints as shown in the sample image.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/storage-mover.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Storage Mover resource page within the Azure portal showing the location of the Storage Endpoints link." lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/storage-mover-lrg.png":::

   1. On the **Storage endpoints** page, the default **Storage endpoints** view displays the names of any provisioned source endpoints and a summary of their associated properties. To view provisioned destination endpoint, select **Target endpoints**. You can filter the results further by selecting the **Protocol** or **Host** filters and the relevant option.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Storage Endpoints page within the Azure portal showing endpoint details and the target endpoint filters location." lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-filter-lrg.png":::

   At this time, the Azure portal doesn't support the direct modification of provisioned endpoints. An endpoint's description, however, can be modified using Azure PowerShell by following [this example](endpoint-manage.md?tabs=powershell#view-and-edit-an-endpoints-properties). Endpoint resources that require updating within the Azure portal should be deleted and recreated.

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

1. Use the `Get-AzStorageMoverEndpoint` cmdlet to retrieve a list of endpoint resources. Optionally, you can supply a `-Name` parameter value to retrieve a specific resource. Calling the cmdlet without the optional parameter returns a list of all provisioned endpoints associated with your storage mover resource.

   The following example retrieves a specific project resource by specifying the **demoTarget** name value.

   ```powershell

     Get-AzStorageMoverEndpoint `
       -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
       -StorageMoverName $storageMoverName ` 
       -Name "demoTarget" 

   ```

   The sample response contains the specified project's properties, including the empty `Description` property.

   ```Response

   Id                           : /subscriptions/<GUID>/resourceGroups/
                                    demoResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.StorageMover/
                                    storageMovers/demoMover/endpoints/smbTargetEndpoint
   Name                         : demoTarget
   Property                     : {
                                    "endpointType": "AzureStorageSmbFileShare",
                                    "description": "",
                                    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
                                    "storageAccountResourceId": "/subscriptions/[GUID]/
                                     resourceGroups/demoResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/
                                     storageAccounts/contosoeuap",
                                    "fileShareName": "demoFileshare"
                                  }
   SystemDataCreatedAt          : 6/22/2023 1:19:00 AM
   SystemDataCreatedBy          : user@contoso.com
   SystemDataCreatedByType      : User
   SystemDataLastModifiedAt     : 6/22/2023 1:19:00 AM
   SystemDataLastModifiedBy     : user@contoso.com
   SystemDataLastModifiedByType : User
   Type                         : microsoft.storagemover/storagemovers/endpoints

   ```

1. You can add the missing description to the endpoint returned in the previous example by including a pipeline operator and the `Update-AzStorageMoverAzStorageSmbFileShareEndpoint` cmdlet. The following example provides the missing **SMB fileshare endpoint** value with the `-Description` parameter.

   ```powershell

     Get-AzStorageMoverEndpoint `
       -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
       -StorageMoverName $storageMoverName ` 
       -Name "demoTarget" | `
     Update-AzStorageMoverAzStorageSmbFileShareEndpoint `
       -Description "SMB fileshare endpoint"

   ```

   The response now contains the updated `Description` property value.

   ```Response

   Id                           : /subscriptions/<GUID>/resourceGroups/
                                    demoResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.StorageMover/
                                    storageMovers/demoMover/endpoints/smbTargetEndpoint
   Name                         : demoTarget
   Property                     : {
                                    "endpointType": "AzureStorageSmbFileShare",
                                    "description": "SMB fileshare endpoint",
                                    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
                                    "storageAccountResourceId": "/subscriptions/[GUID]/
                                     resourceGroups/demoResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/
                                     storageAccounts/contosoeuap",
                                    "fileShareName": "demoFileshare"
                                  }
   SystemDataCreatedAt          : 6/22/2023 1:19:00 AM
   SystemDataCreatedBy          : user@contoso.com
   SystemDataCreatedByType      : User
   SystemDataLastModifiedAt     : 6/22/2023 1:19:00 AM
   SystemDataLastModifiedBy     : user@contoso.com
   SystemDataLastModifiedByType : User
   Type                         : microsoft.storagemover/storagemovers/endpoints

   ```

## Delete an endpoint

The removal of an endpoint resource should be a relatively rare occurrence in your production environment, though there might be occasions where it might be helpful. To delete a Storage Mover endpoint resource, follow the provided example.

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting an endpoint is a permanent action and cannot be undone. It's a good idea to ensure that you're prepared to delete the endpoint since you will not be able to restore it at a later time.

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

   1. To delete an endpoint using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the **Storage mover** resource page. Select **Storage endpoints** from within the navigation pane to access your endpoints as indicated in the following image.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/storage-mover.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Storage Mover resource page within the Azure portal showing the location of the Storage Endpoints link." lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/storage-mover-lrg.png":::

   1. The default **Source endpoints** view displays the names of any provisioned source endpoints and a summary of their associated data. You can select the **Destination endpoints** filter to view the corresponding destination endpoints.

      Locate the name of the endpoint you want to delete and select the corresponding checkbox. After verifying that you've selected the appropriate endpoint, select **Delete** as shown in the following image.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-delete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Storage Mover resource page within the Azure portal showing the location of the Delete button." lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-delete-lrg.png":::

      Your new endpoint is deleted and no longer appears within your list of endpoints as shown in the following example image.

      :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-without.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Endpoint Overview page inferring a newly deleted endpoint."  lightbox="media/endpoint-manage/endpoint-without-lrg.png":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Use the `Remove-AzStorageMoverEndpoint` to permanently delete an endpoint resource. Provide the endpoint's name with the `-Name` parameter, and resource group and storage mover resource names with the `-ResourceGroupName` and `-StorageMoverName` parameters, respectively.

```powershell

Remove-AzStorageMoverEndpoint `
   -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
   -StorageMoverName $storageMoverName ` 
   -Name "demoTarget"

```
