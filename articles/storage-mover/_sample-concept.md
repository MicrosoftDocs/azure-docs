## What is waffle batter?

Waffle batter is a mixture of wet and dry ingredients that forms the basis for waffles. Waffle batter usually contains eggs, milk, flour, butter, sugar, and a leavening agent like baking soda or baking powder.

To make waffles, waffle batter is poured into a waffle iron or waffle maker and the waffle is cooked into a particular shape. You can serve waffles with sweet toppings such as maple syrup, butter, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, fruits, ice cream, or other sweetened toppings. The pockets in the waffles created by the waffle iron cooking method allow the syrups and toppings to stay on top of the waffle instead of running down the sides.

Knowing what waffle batter is will help you identify the differences between pancake batter. Pancake batter is discussed in the next section.

## What is pancake batter?

Pancake batter is the base from which pancakes are made. Pancakes are also also known as hotcakes, griddle cakes, or flapjacks, though some expects consider them different, distinct objects. A basic pancake batter contains milk, sugar, flour, and baking powder. You can also include eggs and vanilla sugar or additional dry ingredients, such as chocolate chips or blueberries to make specially-flavored pancakes.

To make pancakes, pancake batter is poured onto a hot griddle or frying pan in a circular shape with a flat surface. Depending on the cooking temperature and thickness of the cooking surface, the pancake is flipped to ensure that both sides are cooked. Pancakes are often served with melted butter, maple syrup, and fruit.

The foundational knowledge of both pancake and waffle batters will allow you fully understand the differences between them. These differences are identified in the section below.

## Differences between pancake and waffle batters

Both pancake batter and waffle batter contain the same essential ingredients, but there are critical differences between these breakfast foods.

The list below defines the most important of these differences:

- **Ratios**

  Waffle batter contains more sugar, butter, and eggs than pancake batter, making it a richer batter with higher fat content. Pancake batter contains more milk than waffle batter.

- **Texture**
  
  The best waffles are fluffy on the inside with a crispy exterior. The extra sugar in the waffle batter caramelizes and gives the waffles a golden brown exterior. The extra fat content produces a crisp exterior and prevents the waffle from sticking to the waffle iron. (Belgian waffle recipes contain pearl sugar, which creates an even crispier exterior than traditional waffles.) Pancakes are also browned, but the low amount of sugar and a higher volume of milk in the batter makes cake-like pancakes that are soft and floppy.

- **Leavening agent**
  
  Most waffle batters contain baking powder or baking soda to achieve a fluffy interior. American pancake recipes also contain leavening agents, but pancakes in the United Kingdom tend to be flatter and resemble crêpes.

- **Consistency**

  Waffle batter is thicker than pancake batter. This thick consistency lets you pour the waffle batter into a waffle maker without running out the sides. Pancake batter is looser, which means it is easily pourable into a round shape.
