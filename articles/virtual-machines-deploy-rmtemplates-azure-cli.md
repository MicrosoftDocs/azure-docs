# Deploy and Manage Virtual Machines using Azure Resource Manager Templates and the Azure CLI

This article provides guidance on how to automate common tasks for deploying and managing Azure Virtual Machines using Azure Resource Manager templates and the Azure CLI as well as links to more documentation on automation for Virtual Machines. 

## Getting Ready

Before you can use the Azure CLI with Azure resource groups you will need to have the right Azure CLI version and a work or school ID (also called an organizational ID).

### Step 1: Update your Azure CLI version to 0.9.0 or later

Type `azure --version` to see whether you have already installed version 0.9.0 or later 

	azure --version
    0.9.0 (node: 0.10.25)

If your version is not 0.9.0 or later, you'll need to either [install the Azure CLI](xplat-cli-install.md) or update using either one of the native installers or through **npm** by typing `npm update -g azure-cli`.

You can also run Azure CLI as a Docker container using the following [Docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kmouss/azure-cli/)

	docker run -it kmouss/azure-cli

### Step 2: Set your Azure account and subscription

If you don't already have an Azure subscription but you do have an MSDN subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/). Or you can sign up for a [free trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

You you will need to have a work or school account to use Azure resource management templates, if you have one you can type `azure login`, enter your username and password, and you should successfully log in. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you don't have one, you'll see an error message indicating that you need a different type of account. To create one from your current Azure account, see [connecting to your Azure account](xplat-cli-connect.md).

Your account may have more than one subscription. You can list your subscriptions by typing `azure account list`, which might look something like this:

    azure account list
    info:    Executing command account list
    data:    Name                              Id                                    Tenandt Id                            Current
    data:    --------------------------------  ------------------------------------  ------------------------------------  -------
    data:    Contoso Admin                     xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  true   
    data:    Fabrikam dev                      xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  false  
    data:    Fabrikam test                     xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  false  
    data:    Contoso production                xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  false  
    
You can set the current Azure subscription by typing

	`azure account set <subscription name or ID> true

with the subscription name or the ID that has the resources you want to manage.

### Step 3: Switch to the Azure CLI resource group mode

By default, the Azure CLI starts in the service management mode (**asm** mode). Type 

	azure config mode arm

to switch to resource group mode. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] You can switch back to the default set of commands by typing `azure config mode asm`.

## Understanding Azure Resource Templates and Resource Groups

Most applications are built out of a combination of different resource types (such as one or more VMs and Storage accounts, a SQL database, a Virtual Network, or a content delivery network, or *CDN*). The default Azure service management API and the Azure classic portal represented these items using a service-by-service approach, which requires you to deploy and manage the individual services individually (or find other tools that do so), and not as a single logical unit of deployment.

*Azure Resource Manager Templates* make it possible for you to deploy and manage these different resources as one logical deployment unit in a declarative fashion. Instead of imperatively telling Azure what to deploy one command after another, you describe your entire deployment in a JSON file -- all of the resources and associated configuration and deployment parameters -- and tell Azure to deploy those resources as one group. 

You can then manage the overall lifecycle of the group's resources by using Azure CLI resource management commands to:

- Stop, start, or delete all of the resources within the group at once. 
- Apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules to lock down security permissions on them. 
- Audit operations. 
- Tag resources with additional meta-data for better tracking. 

You can learn lots more about Azure resource groups and what they can do for you [here](resource-groups-overview.md). If you're interested in authoring templates, see [Authoring Azure Resource Manager Templates](resource-group-authoring-templates.md). 

## Common Task: Quick-create a VM in Azure

Sometimes you know what image you need, and you need a VM from that image right now and you don't care too much about the infrastructure -- maybe you have to test something on a clean VM. That's when you want to use the `azure vm quick-create` command, and pass the arguments necessary to create a VM and its infrastructure.

First, create your resource group. 

    azure group create coreos-quick westus
    info:    Executing command group create
    + Getting resource group coreos-quick                                          
    + Creating resource group coreos-quick                                         
    info:    Created resource group coreos-quick
    data:    Id:                  /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/coreos-quick
    data:    Name:                coreos-quick
    data:    Location:            westus
    data:    Provisioning State:  Succeeded
    data:    Tags: 
    data:    
    info:    group create command OK
    

Second, you'll need an image. To find an image with the Azure CLI, see [Navigating and Selecting Azure Virtual Machine images with PowerShell and the Azure CLI](resource-groups-vm-searching.md). But for this quickstart, here's a short list of popular images. We'll use CoreOS's Stable image for this quick-create.

> [AZURE.NOTE] For the ComputeImageVersion, you can also simply supply 'latest' as the parameter in both the template langauge and in the Azure CLI. This will allow you to always use the latest and patched version of the image without having to modidfy your scripts or templates. This is shown below.

And away you go with your new VM.

## Common Task: Deploy a VM in Azure from a template

Use the instructions in these sections to deploy a new Azure VM using a template with the Azure CLI. This template creates a single virtual machine in a new virtual network with a single subnet, and unlike `azure vm quick-create`, enables you to describe what you want precisely and repeat it without errors. Here's what this template creates:

![](./media/virtual-machines-deploy-rmtemplates-azure-cli/new-vm.png)
 
### Step 1: Examine the JSON file for the template parameters

Here are the contents of the JSON file for the template. (The template is also located in GitHub [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/101-simple-linux-vm/azuredeploy.json).)

Templates are flexible, so the designer may have chosen to give you lots of parameters, or she may have chosen to offer only a few by creating a template that is more fixed. In order to collect the information you need to pass the template as parameters, open the template file (this topic has a template inline, below) and examine the **parameters** values.

In this case, the template below will ask for:

- a unique storage account name
- an admin username for the VM
- a password
- a domain name for the outside world to use
- and will accept a Ubuntu Server version number -- but only one of a list. 

Once you decide on these values, you're ready to create a group for and deploy this template into your Azure subscription.

            }
        ]
    } 
  
### Step 2: Create the virtual machine with the template

Once you have your parameter values ready, you must create a resource group for your template deployment and then deploy the template.

To create the resource group, type `azure group create <group name> <location>` with the name of the group you want and the data center location into which you want to deploy. This happens quickly:

    azure group create myResourceGroup westus
    info:    Executing command group create
    + Getting resource group myResourceGroup                                       
    + Creating resource group myResourceGroup                                      
    info:    Created resource group myResourceGroup
    data:    Id:                  /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup
    data:    Name:                myResourceGroup
    data:    Location:            westus
    data:    Provisioning State:  Succeeded
    data:    Tags: 
    data:    
    info:    group create command OK
    

Now to create the deployment, call `azure group deployment create` and pass:

- the template file (in the case that you saved the above JSON template to a local file) 
- a template uri (in the case that you want to point at the file in Github or some other web address)
- the resource group into which you want to deploy
- and an optional deployment name. 

You will be prompted to supply the values of parameters in the **"parameters"** section of the JSON file. When you have specified all the parameter values, your deployment will begin. 

Here is an example:

    azure group deployment create --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-simple-linux-vm/azuredeploy.json myResourceGroup firstDeployment
    info:    Executing command group deployment create
    info:    Supply values for the following parameters
    newStorageAccountName: storageaccount
    adminUsername: ops
    adminPassword: password
    dnsNameForPublicIP: newdomainname
    
You will receive the following type of information:

    + Initializing template configurations and parameters                          
    + Creating a deployment                                                        
    info:    Created template deployment "firstDeployment"
    + Registering providers                                                        
    info:    Registering provider microsoft.storage
    info:    Registering provider microsoft.network
    info:    Registering provider microsoft.compute
    + Waiting for deployment to complete                                           
    data:    DeploymentName     : firstDeployment
    data:    ResourceGroupName  : myResourceGroup
    data:    ProvisioningState  : Succeeded
    data:    Timestamp          : 2015-04-28T07:53:55.1828878Z
    data:    Mode               : Incremental
    data:    TemplateLink       : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-simple-linux-vm/azuredeploy.json
    data:    ContentVersion     : 1.0.0.0
    data:    Name                   Type          Value        
    data:    ---------------------  ------------  -------------
    data:    newStorageAccountName  String        storageaccount
    data:    adminUsername          String        ops          
    data:    adminPassword          SecureString  undefined    
    data:    dnsNameForPublicIP     String        newdomainname   
    data:    ubuntuOSVersion        String        14.10        
    info:    group deployment create command OK
    


## Common Task: Create a custom VM image

You've seen the basic usage of templates above, so now we can use similar instructions to create a custom VM from a specific .vhd file in Azure with a template using the Azure CLI. The difference here is that this template creates a single virtual machine from a specified virtual hard disk (VHD). 

### Step 1: Examine the JSON file for the template

Here are the contents of the JSON file for the template that this section uses as an example, but you can always find the template itself [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azurermtemplates/azurermtemplates/master/101-vm-from-user-image/azuredeploy.json).

Again, you will need to find the values you want to enter for the parameters that do not have default values. When you run the `azure group deployment create` command, the Azure CLI will prompt you to enter those values.

                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ]
    }

### Step 2: Obtain the VHD

Obviously, you'll need a .vhd for this. You can either use one you already have in Azure, or you can upload one. 

For a Windows-based virtual machine, see [Create and upload a Windows Server VHD to Azure](virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server.md).

For a Linux-based virtual machine, see [Create and upload a Linux VHD in Azure](virtual-machines-linux-create-upload-vhd.md).

### Step 3: Create the virtual machine with the template

Now you're ready to create a new virtual machine based on the .vhd. Create a group to deploy into, using `azure group create <location>`:

    azure group create myResourceGroupUser eastus
    info:    Executing command group create
    + Getting resource group myResourceGroupUser                                            
    + Creating resource group myResourceGroupUser                                           
    info:    Created resource group myResourceGroupUser
    data:    Id:                  /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupUser
    data:    Name:                myResourceGroupUser
    data:    Location:            eastus
    data:    Provisioning State:  Succeeded
    data:    Tags: 
    data:    
    info:    group create command OK
    
Then create the deployment, using the `--template-uri` option to call in the template directly (or you can use the `--template-file` option to use a file that you have saved locally). Note that because the template has defaults specified, you are only prompted for a few things. If you deploy the template in different places, you may find some naming collisions occur with the default values (particularly the DNS name you create).

    azure group deployment create \
    > --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azurermtemplates/azurermtemplates/master/101-vm-from-user-image/azuredeploy.json \
    > myResourceGroup \
    > customVhdDeployment
    info:    Executing command group deployment create
    info:    Supply values for the following parameters
    adminUserName: ops
    adminPassword: password
    osType: linux
    subscriptionId: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
        
Output looks something like the following:

    + Initializing template configurations and parameters                          
    + Creating a deployment

## Deploy a multi-VM application that uses a virtual network and an external load balancer

This template allows you to create 2 Virtual Machines under a Load balancer and configure a load balancing rule on Port 80. This template also deploys a Storage Account, Virtual Network, Public IP address, Availability Set and Network Interfaces.

![](./media/virtual-machines-deploy-rmtemplates-azure-cli/multivmextlb.png)
 
Follow these steps to deploy a multi-VM application that uses a virtual network and a load balancer using a Resource Manager template in the Github template repository using Azure PowerShell commands.

### Step 1: Examine the JSON file for the template.

Here are the contents of the JSON file for the template. If you want the most recent version, it's located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/201-2-vms-loadbalancer-lbrules/azuredeploy.json). This topic uses the `--template-uri` switch to call in the template, but you can also use the `--template-file` switch to pass a local version.

                }
            }
        ]
    }

### Step 2: Create the deployment with the template.

Create a resource group for the template using `azure group create <location>`, and then create a deployment into that resource group using `azure group deployment create` and passing the resource group, a deployment name, and answering the prompts for parameters in the template that did not have default values.


    azure group create lbgroup westus
    info:    Executing command group create
    + Getting resource group lbgroup                                               
    + Creating resource group lbgroup                                              
    info:    Created resource group lbgroup
    data:    Id:                  /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/lbgroup
    data:    Name:                lbgroup

    data:    Provisioning State:  Succeeded
    data:    Tags: 
    data:    
    info:    group create command OK
    

Now use the `azure group deployment create` command and the `--template-uri` option to deploy the template. Be ready with your parameter values when it prompts you, as below. 

    azure group deployment create \
    > --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/201-2-vms-loadbalancer-lbrules/azuredeploy.json \

Note that this template deploys a Windows Server image; however, it could easily be replaced by any Linux image, too. Want to create a Docker Cluster across multiple regions? [You can do it](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/201-discover-private-ip-dynamically/). 

## Remove a resource group

Remember that you can redeploy to a resource group, but if you done with one, you delete it using `azure group delete <group name>`. 

    azure group delete myResourceGroup
    info:    Executing command group delete
    Delete resource group myResourceGroup? [y/n] y
    + Deleting resource group myResourceGroup                                               
    info:    group delete command OK
    
## Show the log for a resource group deployment

This one is quite common while creating or using templates. The call to display the deployment logs for a group is `azure group log show <groupname>`, which displays quite a bit of information useful to understand why something happened -- or didn't. (For more information on troubleshooting your deployments, as well as other information about issues, see [Troubleshooting Resource Group Deployments in Azure](resource-group-deploy-debug.md).)

To target specific failures, for example, you might use tools like **jq** to query things a bit more precisely, such as which individual failures you need to correct. The following example uses **jq** to parse a deployment log for the **lbgroup**, looking for failures

    azure group log show lbgroup -l --json | jq '.[] | select(.status.value == "Failed") | .properties' 

You can discover very quickly what went wrong, fix, and retry. In the following case, the template had been creating two VMs at the same time, which created a lock on the .vhd. (After modifying the template, the deployment succeeded quickly.)

    {
      "statusCode": "Conflict",
      "statusMessage": "{\"status\":\"Failed\",\"error\":{\"code\":\"ResourceDeploymentFailure\",\"message\":\"The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state 'Failed'.\",\"details\":[{\"code\":\"AcquireDiskLeaseFailed\",\"message\":\"Failed to acquire lease while creating disk 'osdisk' using blob with URI http://storage.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/osdisk.vhd.\"}]}}"
    }
    

## Display information about a virtual machine

You can see information about specific VMs in your resource group using the `azure vm show <groupname> <vmname> command`. You might need to list the VMs in a group, first, if you have more than one, using `azure vm list <groupname>`.

    info:    vm show command OK
    

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you want to programmatically store and manipulate the output of your console commands, you may want to use a JSON parsing tool such as **[jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq)**, **[jsawk](https://github.com/micha/jsawk)**, or language libraries good for the task. 

## Show information about a VM

This is a basic task you'll use often. Use it to get information about a VM, perform tasks on a VM, or get output to store in a variable. 

To get info about the VM, run this command, replacing everything in the quotes, including the < and > characters:

     azure vm show -g <group name> -n <virtual machine name>

To store the output in a $vm variable as a JSON document, run:

    vmInfo=$(azure vm show -g <group name> -n <virtual machine name> --json)
    
or you can pipe the stdout to a file.

## Log on to a Linux-based virtual machine

Typically Linux machines are connected to through SSH. For more information, see [How to Use SSH with Linux on Azure](virtual-machines-linux-use-ssh-key.md).

## Stop a VM

Run this command:

    azure vm stop <group name> <virtual machine name>

>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] Use this parameter to keep the virtual IP (VIP) of the cloud service in case it's the last VM in that cloud service. <br><br> If you use the StayProvisioned parameter, you'll still be billed for the VM.

## Start a VM

Run this command:
Azure Resource Manager Overview
    azure vm start <group name> <virtual machine name>

## Attach a Data Disk

You'll also need to decide whether to attach a new disk or one that contains data. For a new disk, the command creates the .vhd file and attaches it in the same command.

To attach a new disk, run this command:

     azure vm disk attach-new <resource-group> <vm-name> <size-in-gb> 

To attach an existing data disk, run this command:

    azure vm disk attach <resource-group> <vm-name> [vhd-url]
    
Then you'll need to mount the disk, as you normally would in Linux (or in Windows).
