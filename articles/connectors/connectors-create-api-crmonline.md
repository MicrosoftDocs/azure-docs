# Connect to Dynamics 365 from workflows in Azure Logic Apps (Deprecated)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> The Dynamics 365 connector is officially deprecated and is no longer available. Instead, use the 
> [Microsoft Dataverse connector](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/) to access Microsoft Dataverse 
> used for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Microsoft Dynamics 365 
> Field Service, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation.
>
> The Dataverse connector replaces the Microsoft Dataverse (Legacy) connector, previously named as the 
> Common Data Service 2.0 connector, which replaced the Dynamics 365 connector.
