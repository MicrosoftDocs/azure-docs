# Deploy and manage Azure Container Instances by using Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption.md)]

With Azure Logic Apps and the Azure Container Instance connector, you can set up automated tasks and workflows that deploy and manage [container groups](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups). The Container Instance connector supports the following actions:

* Create or delete a container group
* Get the properties of a container group
* Get a list of container groups
* Get the logs of a container instance

Use these actions in your logic apps for tasks such as running a container workload in response to a Logic Apps trigger. You can also have other actions use the output from Container Instance actions. 

This connector provides only actions, so to start your logic app, 
use a separate trigger, such as a **Recurrence** trigger to run a container workload on a regular schedule. Or, you might have need to trigger a container group deployment after an event such as arrival of an Outlook e-mail. 

If you're new to logic apps, review 
[What is Azure Logic Apps?](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
[sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142Fs). 

* Basic knowledge about how to create logic apps and how to create container instances

  * [Create an example Consumption logic app workflow](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow.md)

  * [Create and manage container instances](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-quickstart)

* The logic app where you want to access your container instances. To use an action, start your logic app with another trigger, for example, the **Recurrence** trigger.

## Add a Container Instance action

[!INCLUDE [Create connection general intro](../../includes/connectors-create-connection-general-intro.md)]

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), 
and open your logic app in Logic App Designer, if not open already.

1. Choose a path: 

   * Under the last step where you want to add an action, 
   choose **New step**. 

     -or-

   * Between the steps where you want to add an action, 
   move your pointer over the arrow between steps. 
   Choose the plus sign (**+**) that appears, 
   and then select **Add an action**.

1. In the search box, enter "container instance" as your filter. 
Under the actions list, select the Azure Container Instance connector action you want.

1. Provide a name for your connection. 

1. Provide the necessary details for your selected action 
and continue building your logic app's workflow.

  For example, select **Create container group** and enter the properties for a container group and one or more container instances in the group, as shown in the following image (partial detail):

## Connector reference

For technical details about triggers, actions, and limits, which are 
described by the connector's OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) description, 
review the connector's [reference page](/connectors/aci/) or container group [YAML reference](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-reference-yaml).

## Next steps

* See a [sample logic app](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aci-logicapps-integration) that runs a container in Azure Container Instances to analyze the sentiment of e-mail or X text
