# Access and manage IBM DB2 resources by using Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption.md)]

With [Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) and the 
[IBM DB2 connector](/connectors/db2/), you can create automated 
tasks and workflows based on the resources stored in your DB2 database. 
Your workflows can connect to the resources in your database, read and 
list your database tables, add rows, change rows, delete rows, and more. 
You can include actions in your logic apps that get responses 
from your database and make the output available for other actions.

This article shows how you can create a logic app that performs 
various database operations. If you're new to logic apps, review 
[What is Azure Logic Apps?](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md)

## Supported platforms and versions

The DB2 connector includes a Microsoft client that 
communicates with remote DB2 servers across a TCP/IP network. 
You can use this connector for accessing cloud databases such 
as IBM DB2 for Windows running in Azure virtualization. 
You can also access on-premises DB2 databases after you 
[install and set up the on-premises data gateway](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-connection.md).

The IBM DB2 connector supports these IBM DB2 platforms and versions along 
with IBM DB2 compatible products that support Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) 
SQL Access Manager (SQLAM) versions 10 and 11:

| Platform | Version | 
|----------|---------|
| IBM DB2 for z/OS | 12, 11.1, 10.1 |
| IBM DB2 for i | 7.3, 7.2, 7.1 |
| IBM DB2 for LUW | 11, 10.5 |
|||

## Supported database operations

The IBM DB2 connector supports these database operations, 
which map to the corresponding actions in the connector:

| Database operation | Connector action |
|--------------------|------------------|
| List database tables | Get tables |
| Read one row using SELECT | Get row |
| Read all rows using SELECT | Get rows |
| Add one row using INSERT | Insert row |
| Edit one row using UPDATE | Update row |
| Remove one row using DELETE | Delete row |
|||

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
[sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An IBM DB2 database, either cloud-based or on-premises

* Basic knowledge about how to create logic apps. For more information, see [Create an example Consumption logic app workflow](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow.md)

* The logic app where you want to access your DB2 database. 
This connector provides only actions, so to start your logic app, 
select a separate trigger, for example, the **Recurrence** trigger.
The examples in this article use the **Recurrence** trigger.

<a name="add-db2-action"></a>

## Add DB2 action - Get tables

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your 
logic app in the Logic App Designer, if not already open.

1. Under the trigger, choose **New step**.

1. In the search box, enter "db2" as your filter. For this example, 
under the actions list, select this action: **Get tables (Preview)**

   ![Select action](./media/connectors-create-api-db2/select-db2-action.png)

   You're now prompted to provide connection details for your DB2 database.

1. Follow the steps for creating connections for [cloud databases](#cloud-connection) 
or [on-premises databases](#on-premises-connection).

## Insert row

To add a single record to a DB2 database table, 
use the **Insert row** action in your logic app. 
This action runs a DB2 `INSERT` statement, for example, 
`INSERT INTO AREA (AREAID, AREADESC, REGIONID) VALUES ('99999', 'Area 99999', 102)`.

1. If you've never used DB2 actions before in your logic app, 
review the steps in the [Add DB2 action - Get tables](#add-db2-action) 
section, but add the **Insert row** action instead, and then return here to continue.

   After you add the **Insert row** action, here is how your example logic app appears:

   ![Insert row action](./media/connectors-create-api-db2/db2-insert-row-action.png)

1. Specify values for all the required properties (*).

## Update row

To update a single record in a DB2 database table, 
use the **Update row** action in your logic app. 
This action runs a DB2 `UPDATE` statement, for example, 
`UPDATE AREA SET AREAID = '99999', AREADESC = 'Updated 99999', REGIONID = 102)`.

1. If you've never used DB2 actions before in your logic app, 
review the steps in the [Add DB2 action - Get tables](#add-db2-action) 
section, but add the **Update row** action instead, and then return here to continue.

   After you add the **Update row** action, here is how your example logic app appears:

   ![Update row action](./media/connectors-create-api-db2/db2-update-row-action.png)

1. Specify values for all the required properties (*). 
After you select a table, the action shows the relevant 
properties that are specific to records in that table.

   For this example, here are the properties:

   The outputs include the record you updated in your specified table.

   ![View output with updated row](./media/connectors-create-api-db2/db2-connector-update-row-outputs.png)

## Delete row

To delete a single record from a DB2 database table, 
use the **Delete row** action in your logic app. 
This action runs a DB2 `DELETE` statement, for example, 
`DELETE FROM AREA WHERE AREAID = '99999'`.

1. If you've never used DB2 actions before in your logic app,
