# Connect to IBM DB2 resources from workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

When your automated integration workflow needs to work with resources in your DB2 database, use the [**DB2** connector](/connectors/db2/) to perform different operations on your database. For example, your workflow can read, list tables or rows, add rows, update rows, delete rows, and more. These actions can return data from your database for other actions in your workflow to use.

The DB2 connector includes a Microsoft client that communicates with remote DB2 servers across a TCP/IP network. You can use this connector to access cloud databases such as IBM DB2 for Windows running in Azure virtualization.

This guide shows how to add a DB2 action to your workflow and set up a connection to your DB2 database.

## Supported platforms and versions

The DB2 connector supports the following IBM DB2 platforms and versions along with IBM DB2 compatible products that support Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) SQL Access Manager (SQLAM) versions 10 and 11:

| Platform | Version | 
|----------|---------|
| IBM DB2 for z/OS | 12, 11.1, 10.1 |
| IBM DB2 for i | 7.3, 7.2, 7.1 |
| IBM DB2 for LUW | 11, 10.5 |

## Connector technical reference

The DB2 connector supports the following database operations, which map to the corresponding actions in the connector:

| Database operation | Connector action |
|--------------------|------------------|
| List database tables | Get tables |
| Read one row using SELECT | Get row |
| Read all rows using SELECT | Get rows |
| Add one row using INSERT | Insert row |
| Edit one row using UPDATE | Update row |
| Remove one row using DELETE | Delete row |

For more information about the connector and these actions, see [DB2 connector](/connectors/db2/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. [Get a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

- An IBM DB2 database, either cloud-based or on-premises.

- The logic app resource and workflow from where you want to access your DB2 database.

  The DB2 connector provides only actions. If you have an empty workflow, you must first [add a trigger](../logic-apps/add-trigger-action-workflow.md) that works best for your scenario.

  The examples in this guide use the [**Recurrence** trigger](connectors-native-recurrence.md).

  For more information, see:

  - [Create a Consumption logic app workflow](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow.md)
  - [Create a Standard logic app workflow](../logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md)

- To connect your workflow to on-premises DB2 databases, first [install and set up the on-premises data gateway](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-connection.md).

## Add a DB2 action

The following steps show how to add a DB2 action, such as **Get tables**, to your workflow.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The steps to add any other DB2 action are similar, except for the action's parameters and values that you provide.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app resource and workflow in the designer.

1. Follow the [general steps](../logic-apps/add-trigger-action-workflow.md#add-action) to add the **DB2** action named **Get tables**.

   The connection information pane opens so you can provide details to connect your DB2 database.

1. Follow the steps to create a connection for a [cloud-based database](#cloud-connection) or [on-premises database](#on-premises-connection), then return here to continue.

1. After you successfully create the connection, the **Get tables** action information pane appears and shows that no other information is necessary:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/connectors-create-api-db2/get-tables-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the designer, workflow, and Get tables action.":::

1. Continue to [Test your workflow and view output tables](#view-output-tables).

## Set up your DB2 connection

Follow the steps based on whether you have a cloud or on-premises DB2 database. After you provide the necessary connection details, select **Create new**, and return to the previous steps.

Before you create a connection to an on-premises database, make sure that you [install and set up the on-premises data gateway](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-connection.md).

### Test your workflow and view output tables

To manually run your workflow, on the designer toolbar, from the **Run** list, select **Run**. After your workflow finishes, you can view the output from the run.

1. If the run details page doesn't open, follow these steps based on your logic app:

   - **Consumption**: On the logic app sidebar, under **Development Tools**, select **Logic app designer**.

   - **Standard**: On the workflow sidebar, select **Run history**.

1. In the **Runs history** list, select the latest workflow run, for example:

   - **Consumption**

     :::image type="content" source="./media/connectors-create-api-db2/run-history-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Run history list for Consumption workflow.":::

   - **Standard**

     :::image type="content" source="./media/connectors-create-api-db2/run-history-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Run history list for Standard workflow.":::

1. On the run details page, review the status for each step in your workflow. To view the inputs and outputs for each step, select that step, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/connectors-create-api-db2/get-tables-run-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the inputs and outputs for the Get tables action.":::

   1. To view the inputs in JSON, select **Show raw inputs**.

   1. To view the outputs in JSON, select **Show raw outputs**.

      The outputs include a list of tables, for example:
