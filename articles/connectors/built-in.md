# Built-in connectors in Azure Logic Apps

Built-in connectors provide ways for you to control your workflow's schedule and structure, run your own code, manage or manipulate data, and complete other tasks in your workflows. Different from managed connectors, some built-in connectors aren't tied to a specific service, system, or protocol. For example, you can start almost any workflow on a schedule by using the Recurrence trigger. Or, you can have your workflow wait until called by using the Request trigger. All built-in connectors run natively on the Azure Logic Apps runtime. Some don't require that you create a connection before you use them.

For a smaller number of services, systems, and protocols, Azure Logic Apps provides a built-in version alongside the managed version. The number and range of built-in connectors vary based on whether you create a Consumption logic app workflow that runs in multitenant Azure Logic Apps or a Standard logic app workflow that runs in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. In most cases, the built-in version provides better performance, capabilities, pricing, and so on. In a few cases, some built-in connectors are available only in one logic app workflow type and not the other.

For example, a Standard workflow can use both managed connectors and built-in connectors for Azure Blob Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Service Bus, FTP, IBM DB2, IBM MQ, SFTP, and SQL Server. A Consumption workflow doesn't have the built-in versions. A Consumption workflow can use built-in connectors for Azure API Management, and Azure App Service, while a Standard workflow doesn't have these built-in connectors.

Also, in Standard workflows, some [built-in connectors with specific attributes are informally known as *service providers*](../logic-apps/custom-connector-overview.md#service-provider-interface-implementation). Some built-in connectors support only a single way to authenticate a connection to the underlying service. Other built-in connectors can offer a choice, such as using a connection string, Microsoft Entra ID, or a managed identity. All built-in connectors run in the same process as the Azure Logic Apps runtime. For more information, review [Single-tenant versus multitenant in Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare.md).

This article provides a general overview about built-in connectors in Consumption workflows versus Standard workflows.

## Built-in connectors in Consumption versus Standard

The following table lists the current and expanding galleries of built-in operations collections available for Consumption versus Standard workflows. For Standard workflows, an asterisk (**\***) marks [built-in connectors based on the *service provider* model](#service-provider-interface-implementation), which is described in more detail later.

| Consumption | Standard |

| Azure API Management <br>Azure App Service <br>Azure Functions <br>Azure Logic Apps <br>Batch Operations <br>Control <br>Data Operations <br>Date Time <br>Flat File <br>HTTP <br>Inline Code <br>Integration Account <br>Liquid Operations <br>Request <br>Schedule <br>Variables <br>XML Operations | AS2 (v2) <br>Azure AI Search* <br>Azure API Management <br>Azure Automation* <br>Azure Blob Storage* <br>Azure Cosmos DB* <br>Azure Event Grid Publisher* <br>Azure Event Hubs* <br>Azure File Storage* <br>Azure Functions <br>Azure Key Vault* <br>Azure OpenAI* <br>Azure Queue Storage* <br>Azure Service Bus* <br>Azure Table Storage* <br>Batch Operations <br>Control <br>Data Mapper Operations <br>Data Operations <br>Date Time <br>EDIFACT <br>File System* <br>Flat File <br>FTP* <br>HTTP <br>IBM 3270* <br>IBM CICS* <br>IBM DB2* <br>IBM Host File* <br>IBM IMS* <br>IBM MQ* <br>Inline Code <br>Integration Account <br>JDBC* <br>Liquid Operations <br>Request <br>RosettaNet <br>SAP* <br>Schedule <br>SFTP* <br>SMTP* <br>SQL Server* <br>SWIFT <br>Variables <br>Workflow Operations <br>X12 <br>XML Operations |

## Service provider-based built-in connectors

In Standard workflows, a built-in connector that has the following attributes is informally known as a *service provider*:

* Is based on the [Azure Functions extensibility model](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-register.md).

* Provides access from a Standard workflow to a service, such as Azure Blob Storage, Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, SFTP, and SQL Server.

  Some built-in connectors support only a single way to authenticate a connection to the underlying service. Other built-in connectors can offer a choice, such as using a connection string, Microsoft Entra ID, or a managed identity.

* Runs in the same process as the redesigned Azure Logic Apps runtime.

Service provider-based built-in connectors are available alongside their [managed connector versions](managed.md).

In contrast, a built-in connector that's *not a service provider* has the following attributes:

* Isn't based on the Azure Functions extensibility model.

* Is directly implemented as a job within the Azure Logic Apps runtime, such as Schedule, HTTP, Request, and XML operations.

<a name="custom-built-in"></a>

## Custom built-in connectors

For Standard workflows, you can create your own built-in connector with the same [built-in connector extensibility model](../logic-apps/custom-connector-overview.md#built-in-connector-extensibility-model) that's used by service provider-based built-in connectors, such as Azure Blob Storage, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Service Bus, SQL Server, and more. This interface implementation is based on the [Azure Functions extensibility model](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-register.md) and provides the capability for you to create custom built-in connectors that anyone can use in Standard workflows.

For Consumption workflows, you can't create your own built-in connectors, but you create your own managed connectors.

For more information, review the following documentation:

* [Custom connectors in Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/custom-connector-overview.md#custom-connector-standard)
* [Create custom built-in connectors for Standard workflows](../logic-apps/create-custom-built-in-connector-standard.md)

<a name="general-built-in"></a>

## General built-in connectors

You can use the following built-in connectors to perform general tasks, for example:

* Run workflows using custom and advanced schedules. For more information about scheduling, review the [Recurrence behavior for connectors in Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/concepts-schedule-automated-recurring-tasks-workflows.md#recurrence-behavior).

* Organize and control your workflow's structure, for example, using loops and conditions.

* Work with variables, dates, data operations, content transformations, and batch operations.

* Communicate with other endpoints using HTTP triggers and actions.

* Receive and respond to requests.

* Call your own functions (Azure Functions) or other Azure Logic Apps workflows that can receive requests, and so on.

## Business-to-business (B2B) built-in operations

Azure Logic Apps supports business-to-business (B2B) communication scenarios through various B2B built-in operations. Based on whether you have a Consumption or Standard workflow and the B2B operations that you want to use, [you might have to create and link an integration account to your logic app resource](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md). You then use this integration account to define your B2B artifacts, such as trading partners, agreements, maps, schemas, certificates, and so on.

* Consumption workflows

  Before you can use any B2B operations in a workflow, [you must create and link an integration account to your logic app resource](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md). After you create your integration account, you must then define your B2B artifacts, such as trading partners, agreements, maps, schemas, certificates, and so on. You can then use the B2B operations to encode and decode messages, transform content, and more.

* Standard workflows

  Some B2B operations require that you [create and link an integration account to your logic app resource](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md). Linking lets you share artifacts across multiple Standard workflows and their child workflows. Based on the B2B operation that you want to use, complete one of the following steps before you use the operation:

  * For operations that require maps or schemas, you can either:

    * Upload these artifacts to your logic app resource using the Azure portal or Visual Studio Code. You can then use these artifacts across all child workflows in the *same* logic app resource. For more information, review [Add maps to use with workflows in Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-maps.md?tabs=standard) and [Add schemas to use with workflows in Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md?tabs=standard).

    * [Link your logic app resource to your integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md).

  * For operations that require a connection to your integration account, create the connection when you add the operation to your workflow.

For more information, review the following documentation:

* [Business-to-business (B2B) enterprise integration workflows](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-overview.md)
* [Create and manage integration accounts for B2B workflows](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md)
