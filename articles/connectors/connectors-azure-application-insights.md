# Connect to Azure Application Insights from workflows in Azure Logic Apps

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The [Azure Monitor Logs connector](/connectors/azuremonitorlogs/) replaces the [Azure Log Analytics connector](/connectors/azureloganalytics/) 
> and the [Azure Application Insights connector](/connectors/applicationinsights/). This combined connector provides the same functionality as 
> the other connectors and is the preferred method for running a query against a Log Analytics workspace or an Application Insights resource.
> 
> For example, when you connect to your Application Insights resource, you don't have to create or provide an application ID and API key. 
> Authentication is integrated with Microsoft Entra ID. For the how-to guide to use the Azure Monitor Logs connector, see 
> [Connect to Log Analytics or Application Insights from workflows in Azure Logic Apps](connectors-azure-monitor-logs.md).
