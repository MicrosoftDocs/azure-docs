# Connect to an FTP server from workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

This article shows how to access your File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server from a workflow in Azure Logic Apps with the FTP connector. You can then create automated workflows that run when triggered by events in your FTP server or in other systems and run actions to manage files on your FTP server.

For example, your workflow can start with an FTP trigger that monitors and responds to events on your FTP server. The trigger makes the outputs available to subsequent actions in your workflow. Your workflow can run FTP actions that create, send, receive, and manage files through your FTP server account using the following specific tasks:

* Monitor when files are added or changed.
* Create, copy, delete, list, and update files.
* Get file metadata and content.
* Manage folders.

If you're new to Azure Logic Apps, review the following get started documentation:

* [What is Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md)
* [Quickstart: Create an example Consumption logic app workflow](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow.md)

## Connector technical reference

The FTP connector has different versions, based on [logic app type and host environment](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences).

| Logic app type (plan) | Environment | Connector version |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Consumption** | Multitenant Azure Logic Apps | Managed connector, which appears in the connector gallery under **Runtime** > **Shared**. For more information, review the following documentation: <br><br>- [FTP managed connector reference](/connectors/ftp) <br>- [Managed connectors in Azure Logic Apps](managed.md) |
| **Standard** | Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps and App Service Environment v3 (Windows plans only) | Managed connector (Azure-hosted), which appears in the connector gallery under **Runtime** > **Shared**, and built-in connector, which appears in the connector gallery under **Runtime** > **In App** and is [service provider based](../logic-apps/custom-connector-overview.md#service-provider-interface-implementation). The built-in connector can directly access Azure virtual networks with a connection string. For more information, review the following documentation: <br><br>- [FTP managed connector reference](/connectors/ftp) <br>- [FTP built-in connector operations](#built-in-operations) section later in this article <br>- [Managed connectors in Azure Logic Apps](managed.md) <br>- [Built-in connectors in Azure Logic Apps](built-in.md) |

## Limitations

* Capacity and throughput

  * Built-in connector for Standard workflows:

    By default, FTP actions can read or write files that are *200 MB or smaller*. Currently, the FTP built-in connector doesn't support chunking.

  * Managed or Azure-hosted connector for Consumption and Standard workflows

    By default, FTP actions can read or write files that are *50 MB or smaller*. To handle files larger than 50 MB, FTP actions support [message chunking](../logic-apps/logic-apps-handle-large-messages.md). The **Get file content** action implicitly uses chunking.

* Triggers for the FTP managed or Azure-hosted connector might experience missing, incomplete, or delayed results when the "last modified" timestamp is preserved. On the other hand, the FTP *built-in* connector trigger in Standard logic app workflows doesn't have this limitation. For more information, review the FTP connector's [Limitations](/connectors/ftp/#limitations) section.

* The FTP managed or Azure-hosted connector can create a limited number of connections to the FTP server, based on the connection capacity in the Azure region where your logic app resource exists. If this limit poses a problem in a Consumption logic app workflow, consider creating a Standard logic app workflow and use the FTP built-in connector instead.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* The logic app workflow where you want to access your FTP account. To start your workflow with an FTP trigger, you have to start with a blank workflow. To use an FTP action, start your workflow with another trigger, such as the **Recurrence** trigger.

* For more requirements that apply to both the FTP managed connector and built-in connector, review the [FTP managed connector reference - Requirements](/connectors/ftp/#requirements).

## Known issues

[!INCLUDE [Managed connector trigger "Split On" setting issue](../../includes/connectors-managed-trigger-split-on.md)]

<a name="add-ftp-trigger"></a>

## Add an FTP trigger

A Consumption logic app workflow can use only the FTP managed connector. However, a Standard logic app workflow can use the FTP managed connector *and* the FTP built-in connector. In a Standard logic app workflow, managed connectors are also labeled as **Azure** connectors.

The FTP managed connector and built-in connector each have only one trigger available:

* Managed connector trigger: The FTP trigger named **When a file is added or modified (properties only)** runs a Consumption or Standard logic app workflow when one or more files are added or changed in a folder on the FTP server. This trigger gets only the file properties or metadata, not the file content. However, to get the file content, your workflow can follow this trigger with other FTP actions.

  For more information about this trigger, review [When a file is added or modified (properties only)](/connectors/ftp/#when-a-file-is-added-or-modified-(properties-only)).

* Built-in connector trigger: The FTP trigger named **When a file is added or updated** runs a Standard logic app workflow when one or more files are added or changed in a folder on the FTP server. This trigger gets only the file properties or metadata, not the file content. However, to get the content, your workflow can follow this trigger with other FTP actions. For more information about this trigger, review [When a file is added or updated](#when-file-added-updated).

The following steps use the Azure portal, but with the appropriate Azure Logic Apps extension, you can also use the following tools to create and edit logic app workflows:

* Consumption logic app workflows: [Visual Studio Code](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code.md)

* Standard logic app workflows: [Visual Studio Code](../logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code.md)

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and open your blank logic app workflow in the designer.

1. On the designer, under the search box, select **Standard**. In the search box, enter **ftp**.

1. From the triggers list, select the trigger named **When a filed is added or modified (properties only)**.

   ![Screenshot shows Azure portal, Consumption workflow designer, and FTP trigger selected.](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-select-trigger-consumption.png)

1. Provide the [information for your connection](/connectors/ftp/#creating-a-connection). When you're done, select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > By default, this connector transfers files in text format. To transfer files in binary format, 
   > for example, where and when encoding is used, select the binary transport option.

   ![Screenshot shows Consumption workflow designer and FTP connection profile.](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-trigger-connection-consumption.png)

1. After the trigger information box appears, find the folder that you want to monitor for new or edited files.

   1. In the **Folder** box, select the folder icon to view the folder directory.

   1. Select the right angle arrow (**>**). Browse to the folder that you want, and then select the folder.

   ![Screenshot shows Consumption workflow designer, FTP trigger, and "Folder" property where browsing for folder to select.](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-trigger-select-folder-consumption.png)

   Your selected folder appears in the **Folder** box.

   ![Screenshot shows Consumption workflow designer, FTP trigger, and "Folder" property with selected folder.](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-trigger-selected-folder-consumption.png)

1. When you're done, save your workflow.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

This section shows the steps for the following FTP connector triggers:

* [*Built-in* trigger named **When a file is added or updated**](#built-in-connector-trigger)

  If you use this FTP built-in trigger, you can get the file content by just using the FTP built-in action named **Get file content** without using the **Get file metadata** action first, unlike when you use the FTP managed trigger. For more information about FTP built-in connector operations, review [FTP built-in connector operations](#ftp-built-in-connector-operations) later in this article.

* [*Managed* trigger named **When a file is added or modified (properties only)**](#managed-connector-trigger)

  If you use this FTP managed trigger, you have to later use the **Get file metadata** action first to get a single array item before you use any other action on the file that was added or modified. This workaround results from the [known issue around the **Split On** setting](#known-issues) described earlier in this article.

1. When you're done, save your logic app workflow.

---

When you save your workflow, this step automatically publishes your updates to your deployed logic app, which is live in Azure. With only a trigger, your workflow just checks the FTP server based on your specified schedule. You have to [add an action](#add-ftp-action) that responds to the trigger and does something with the trigger outputs.

<a name="add-ftp-action"></a>

## Add an FTP action

A Consumption logic app workflow can use only the FTP managed connector. However, a Standard logic app workflow can use the FTP managed connector and the FTP built-in connector. Each version has multiple actions. For example, both managed and built-in connector versions have their own actions to get file metadata and get file content.

* Managed connector actions: These actions run in a Consumption or Standard logic app workflow.

* Built-in connector actions: These actions run only in a Standard logic app workflow.

The following steps use the Azure portal, but with the appropriate Azure Logic Apps extension, you can also use the following tools to build logic app workflows:

* Consumption workflows: [Visual Studio Code](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-logic-apps-visual-studio-code.md)
* Standard workflows: [Visual Studio Code](../logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code.md)

Before you can use an FTP action, your workflow must already start with a trigger, which can be any kind that you choose. For example, you can use the generic **Recurrence** built-in trigger to start your workflow on specific schedule.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and open your logic app workflow in the designer.

1. Find and select the [FTP action](/connectors/ftp/) that you want to use.

   This example continues with the action named **Get file metadata** so you can get the metadata for a single array item.

   1. On the designer, under the trigger or any other actions, select **New step**.

   1. Under the **Choose an operation** search box, select **Standard**.

   1. In the search box, enter **ftp get file metadata**.

   1. From the actions list, select the action named **Get file metadata**.

   ![Screenshot shows the Azure portal, Consumption workflow designer, search box with "ftp get file metadata" entered, and "Get file metadata" action selected.](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-get-file-metadata-action-consumption.png)

1. If necessary, provide the [information for your connection](/connectors/ftp/#creating-a-connection). When you're done, select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > By default, this connector transfers files in text format. To transfer files in binary format, 
   > for example, where and when encoding is used, select the binary transport option.

   ![Screenshot shows Consumption workflow designer and FTP connection profile for an action.](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-action-connection-consumption.png)

1. After the **Get file metadata** action information box appears, click inside the **File** box so that the dynamic content list opens.

   You can now select outputs from the preceding trigger.

1. In the dynamic content list, under **When a file is added or modified**, select **List of Files Id**.

   ![Screenshot shows Consumption workflow designer, "Get file metadata" action, dynamic content list opened, and "List of Files Id" selected.](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-get-file-metadata-list-files-id-output-consumption.png)

   The **File** property now references the **List of Files Id** trigger output.

1. On the designer, under the **Get file metadata** action, select **New step**.

1. Under the **Choose an operation** search box, select **Standard**.

1. In the search box, enter **ftp get file content**.

1. From the actions list, select the action named **Get file content**.

   ![Screenshot shows the Azure portal, Consumption workflow designer, search box with "ftp get file content" entered, and "Get file content" action selected.](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-get-file-content-action-consumption.png)

1. After the **Get file content** action information box appears, click inside the **File** box so that the dynamic content list opens.

   You can now select outputs from the preceding trigger and any other actions.

1. In the dynamic content list, under **Get file metadata**, select **Id**, which references the file that was added or updated.

   ![Screenshot shows Consumption workflow designer, "Get file content" action, and "File" property with dynamic content list opened and "Id" property selected.](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-get-file-content-id-output-consumption.png)

   The **File** property now references the **Id** action output.

   ![Screenshot shows Consumption workflow designer, "Get file content" action, and "File" property with "Id" entered.](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-get-file-content-id-entered-consumption.png)

1. When you're done, save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

The steps to add and use an FTP action differ based on whether your workflow uses the built-in connector or the managed, Azure-hosted connector.

* [**Built-in trigger**](#built-in-trigger-workflows): Describes the steps to add a built-in action.

  If you used the FTP built-in trigger, and you want the content from a newly added or updated file, you can use a **For each** loop to iterate through the array that's returned by the trigger. You can then use just the **Get file content** action without any other intermediary actions. For more information about FTP built-in connector operations, review [FTP built-in connector operations](#ftp-built-in-connector-operations) later in this article.

* [**Managed trigger**](#managed-trigger-workflows): Describes the steps to add a managed action.

 If you used the FTP managed connector trigger, and want the content from a newly added or modified file, you can use a **For each** loop to iterate through the array that's returned by the trigger. You then have to use intermediary actions such as the FTP action named **Get file metadata** before you use the **Get file content** action.

### When a file is added or updated

Operation ID: `whenFtpFilesAreAddedOrModified`

This trigger starts a logic app workflow run when a file is added or updated in the specified folder on the FTP server. The trigger gets only the file metadata or properties, not any file content. However, to get the content, your workflow can follow this trigger with the [**Get file content**](#get-file-content) action.

#### Parameters

| Name | Key | Required | Type | Description |
|------|-----|----------|------|-------------|
| **Folder path** | `folderPath` | True | `string` | The folder path, relative to the root directory. |
| **Number of files to return** | `maxFileCount` | False | `integer` | The maximum number of files to return from a single trigger run. Valid values range from 1 - 100. <br><br>**Note**: By default, the **Split On** setting is enabled and forces this trigger to process each file individually in parallel. |
| **Cutoff timestamp to ignore older files** | `oldFileCutOffTimestamp` | False | `dateTime` | The cutoff time to use for ignoring older files. Use the timestamp format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`. To disable this feature, leave this property empty. |
||||||

#### Returns

When the trigger's **Split On** setting is enabled, the trigger returns the metadata or properties for one file at a time. Otherwise, the trigger returns an array that contains each file's metadata.
