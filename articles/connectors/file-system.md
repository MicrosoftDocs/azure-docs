# Connect to on-premises file systems from workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

This how-to guide shows how to access an on-premises file share from a workflow in Azure Logic Apps by using the File System connector. You can then create automated workflows that run when triggered by events in your file share or in other systems and run actions to manage your files. The connector provides the following capabilities:

- Create, get, append, update, and delete files.
- List files in folders or root folders.
- Get file content and metadata.

In this how-to guide, the example scenarios demonstrate the following tasks:

- Trigger a workflow when a file is created or added to a file share, and then send an email.
- Trigger a workflow when copying a file from a Dropbox account to a file share, and then send an email.

## Limitations and known issues

- The File System connector currently supports only Windows file systems on Windows operating systems.
- Mapped network drives aren't supported.

## Connector technical reference

The File System connector has different versions, based on [logic app type and host environment](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences).

| Logic app | Environment | Connector version |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Consumption** | Multitenant Azure Logic Apps | Managed connector, which appears in the connector gallery under **Runtime** > **Shared**. For more information, review the following documentation: <br><br>- [File System managed connector reference](/connectors/filesystem/) <br>- [Managed connectors in Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/managed.md) |
| **Standard** | Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps and App Service Environment v3 (Windows plans only) | Managed connector, which appears in the connector gallery under **Runtime** > **Shared**, and built-in connector, which appears in the connector gallery under **Runtime** > **In-App** and is [service provider-based](../logic-apps/custom-connector-overview.md#service-provider-interface-implementation). The built-in connector differs in the following ways: <br><br>- The built-in connector supports only Standard logic apps that run in an App Service Environment v3 with Windows plans only. <br><br>- The built-in version can connect directly to a file share and access Azure virtual networks by using a connection string without an on-premises data gateway. <br><br>For more information, review the following documentation: <br><br>- [File System managed connector reference](/connectors/filesystem/) <br>- [File System built-in connector reference](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/filesystem/) <br>- [Built-in connectors in Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/built-in.md) |

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* To connect to your file share, different requirements apply, based on your logic app and the hosting environment:

  - Consumption logic app workflows

    - In multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps, you need to meet the following requirements, if you haven't already:
    
      1. [Install the on-premises data gateway on a local computer](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install.md).

         The File System managed connector requires that your gateway installation and file system server must exist in the same Windows domain.

      1. [Create an on-premises data gateway resource in Azure](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-connection.md).

      1. After you add a File System managed connector trigger or action to your workflow, select the data gateway resource that you previously created so you can connect to your file system.

  - Standard logic app workflows

    You can use the File System built-in connector or managed connector.

    * To use the File System managed connector, follow the same requirements as a Consumption logic app workflow in multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps.

    * To use the File System built-in connector, your Standard logic app workflow must run in App Service Environment v3, but doesn't require the data gateway resource.

* Access to the computer that has the file system you want to use. For example, if you install the data gateway on the same computer as your file system, you need the account credentials for that computer.

* To follow the example scenario in this how-to guide, you need an email account from a provider that's supported by Azure Logic Apps, such as Office 365 Outlook, Outlook.com, or Gmail. For other providers, [review other supported email connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors). This example uses the Office 365 Outlook connector with a work or school account. If you use another email account, the overall steps are the same, but your UI might slightly differ.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > If you want to use the Gmail connector, only G-Suite business accounts can use this connector without restriction in logic apps. 
  > If you have a Gmail consumer account, you can use this connector with only specific Google-approved services, or you can 
  > [create a Google client app to use for authentication with your Gmail connector](/connectors/gmail/#authentication-and-bring-your-own-application). 
  > For more information, see [Data security and privacy policies for Google connectors in Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/connectors-google-data-security-privacy-policy.md).

* For the example File System action scenario, you need a [Dropbox account](https://www.dropbox.com/), which you can sign up for free.

* The logic app workflow where you want to access your file share. To start your workflow with a File System trigger, you have to start with a blank workflow. To add a File System action, start your workflow with any trigger.
