# Get started with the Trello connector
Trello gives you perspective over all your projects, at work and at home.  It is an easy, free, flexible, and visual way to manage your projects and organize anything.  Connect to Trello to manage your boards, lists and cards.

Get started by creating a logic app; see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Create a connection to Trello
To create Logic apps with Trello, first create a **connection**, and enter the details for the following properties:

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token |Yes |Provide Trello Credentials |

After you create the connection, you can use it to execute the actions and listen for the triggers.

## Connector-specific details

View any triggers and actions defined in the swagger, and also see any limits in the [connector details](/connectors/trello/).
