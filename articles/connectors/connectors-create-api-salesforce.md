# Get started with the Salesforce connector
The Salesforce Connector provides an API to work with Salesforce objects.

To use [any connector](apis-list.md), you first need to create a logic app. You can get started by [creating a logic app now](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Connect to Salesforce connector
Before your logic app can access any service, you first need to create a *connection* to the service. A [connection](connectors-overview.md) provides connectivity between a logic app and another service.  

### Create a connection to Salesforce connector
> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to Salesforce Connector](../../includes/connectors-create-api-salesforce.md)]
>

## Use a Salesforce connector trigger
A trigger is an event that can be used to start the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about triggers](../logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts).

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a Salesforce trigger](../../includes/connectors-create-api-salesforce-trigger.md)]

> 

## Add a condition
> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a Salesforce condition](../../includes/connectors-create-api-salesforce-condition.md)]
> 
> 

## Use a Salesforce connector action
An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about actions](../logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts).
