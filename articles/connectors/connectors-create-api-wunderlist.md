# Monitor and manage Wunderlist in Azure Logic Apps

As of May 6, 2020, the [Wunderlist service shut down](https://www.wunderlist.com/) and asked customers to [migrate their data and start using Microsoft To Do instead](https://www.wunderlist.com/blog/goodbye-from-wunderlist/). You can use the [Microsoft To Do connector](/connectors/todo/) to replace the deprecated [Wunderlist connector](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_wunderlist/wunderlist/).

## Next steps
