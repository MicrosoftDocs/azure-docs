# Receive and respond to inbound HTTPS calls sent to workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

This guide shows how to create a logic app workflow that can receive and handle an inbound HTTPS request from another service by using the **Request** built-in trigger. When your workflow uses this trigger, the workflow can respond to the HTTPS call by using the **Response** built-in action.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The **Response** action works only when you use the **Request** trigger.

For example, your workflow can perform the following tasks when you use the **Request** trigger and **Response** action:

* Receive and respond to an HTTPS request for data in an on-premises database.

* Receive and respond to an HTTPS request sent from another logic app workflow.

* Trigger a workflow run when an external webhook event happens.

To run your workflow by sending an outgoing or outbound request instead, use the [HTTP built-in trigger or HTTP built-in action](connectors-native-http.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- The logic app resource with the workflow where you want to receive the inbound HTTPS request.

  To start your workflow with a **Request** trigger, you need to have a blank workflow. To use the **Response** action, your workflow must start with the **Request** trigger.

  If you don't have a logic app resource and workflow, create them now by following the steps for the logic app that you want:
  
  - [Create an example Consumption logic app workflow](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow.md)
  - [Create an example Standard logic app workflow](../logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md)

## Add a Request trigger

The **Request** trigger creates a manually callable endpoint that handles *only* inbound requests over HTTPS. When the caller sends a request to this endpoint, the **Request** trigger fires and runs the workflow. For information about how to call this trigger, see [Call, trigger, or nest workflows with HTTPS endpoints in Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-http-endpoint.md).

## [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Consumption logic app resource.

1. On the sidebar menu, under **Development Tools**, select the designer to open your blank workflow.

1. Add the **Request** built-in trigger named **When a HTTP request is received** to your workflow by following the [general steps to add a trigger](../logic-apps/add-trigger-action-workflow.md?tabs=consumption#add-trigger).

1. After the trigger information box appears, provide the following information:

   | Property name | JSON property name | Required | Description |
   |---------------|--------------------|----------|-------------|
   | **HTTP URL** | {none} | Yes | The endpoint URL that's generated after you save your workflow and is used for sending a request that triggers your workflow. |
   | **Request Body JSON Schema** | `schema` | No | The JSON schema that describes the properties and values in the incoming request body. The designer uses this schema to generate tokens for the properties in the request. That way, your workflow can parse, consume, and pass along outputs from the **Request** trigger into your workflow. <br><br>If you don't have a JSON schema, you can generate the schema from a sample payload by using the **Use sample payload to generate schema** capability. |

   The following example shows a sample JSON schema:

   :::image type="content" source="media/connectors-native-reqres/provide-json-schema-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Consumption workflow and Request trigger with example JSON schema." lightbox="media/connectors-native-reqres/provide-json-schema-consumption.png":::

   The following example shows the complete sample JSON schema:

   ```json
   {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
         "account": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
               "name": {
                  "type": "string"
               },
               "ID": {
                  "type": "string"
               },
               "address": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                     "number": {
                        "type": "string"
                     },
                     "street": {
                        "type": "string"
                     },
                     "city": {
                        "type": "string"
                     },
                     "state": {
                        "type": "string"
                     },
                     "country": {
                        "type": "string"
                     },
                     "postalCode": {
                        "type": "string"
                     }
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   When you enter a JSON schema, the designer might show a reminder to include the `Content-Type` header in your request and set that header value to `application/json`. For more information, see [Handle content types](../logic-apps/logic-apps-content-type.md).

   The following example shows how the `Content-Type` header appears in JSON format:

   ```json
   {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
   }
   ```

   To generate a JSON schema that's based on the expected payload (data), you can use a tool such as [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org), or you can follow these steps:

   1. In the **Request** trigger, select **Use sample payload to generate schema**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/connectors-native-reqres/generate-from-sample-payload-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Consumption workflow, Request trigger, and option to use sample payload to generate schema." lightbox="media/connectors-native-reqres/generate-from-sample-payload-consumption.png":::

   1. Enter the sample payload, and select **Done**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/connectors-native-reqres/enter-payload-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Consumption workflow, Request trigger, and sample payload entered to generate schema." lightbox="media/connectors-native-reqres/enter-payload-consumption.png":::

      The following example shows the sample payload:

      ```json
      {
         "account": {
            "name": "Contoso",
            "ID": "12345",
            "address": {
               "number": "1234",
               "street": "Anywhere Street",
               "city": "AnyTown",
               "state": "AnyState",
               "country": "USA",
               "postalCode": "11111"
            }
         }
      }
      ```

1. To check that the inbound call has a request body that matches your specified schema, follow these steps:

   1. To enforce the inbound message to have the same exact fields that your schema describes, in your schema, add the `required` property and specify the required fields. Add the `additionalProperties` property, and set the value to *false*.

      For example, the following schema specifies that the inbound message must have the `msg` field and not any other fields:

      ```json
      {
         "properties": {
           "msg": {
              "type": "string"
           }
         },
         "type": "object",
         "required": ["msg"],
         "additionalProperties": false
      }
      ```

   1. On the designer, select the Request trigger. On the information pane that opens, select the **Settings** tab.

   1. Expand **Data Handling**, and set **Schema Validation** to **On**.

      If the inbound call's request body doesn't match your schema, the trigger returns an **HTTP 400 Bad Request** error.

1. From the **Method** list, select the method that the trigger expects inbound requests to use.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connectors-native-reqres/select-method-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Standard workflow, Request trigger, and the Method list opened with a method selected." lightbox="media/connectors-native-reqres/select-method-standard.png":::

1. If any other parameters exist for the trigger, open the **Advanced parameters** list, and select the parameters that you want.

1. When you're ready, save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   This step generates the URL that you can use to send a request that triggers the workflow.

1. To copy the generated URL, select the copy icon next to the URL.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connectors-native-reqres/generated-url-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Consumption workflow, Request trigger, and URL copy button selected." lightbox="media/connectors-native-reqres/generated-url-consumption.png":::

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If you want to include the hash or pound symbol (**#**) in the URI
   > when making a call to the **Request** trigger, use this encoded version instead: `%25%23`

## [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the resource sidebar menu, under **Workflows**, select **Workflows**, and then select your blank workflow.
	
1. On the workflow sidebar menu, under **Tools**, select the designer to open the workflow.

1. Add the **Request** built-in trigger named **When a HTTP request is received** to your workflow by following the [general steps to add a trigger](../logic-apps/add-trigger-action-workflow.md?tabs=standard#add-trigger).

1. After the trigger information box appears, provide the following information as required:

   | Property name | JSON property name | Required | Description |
   |---------------|--------------------|----------|-------------|
   | **HTTP URL** | {none} | Yes | The endpoint URL that's generated after you save your workflow and is used for sending a request that triggers your workflow. |
   | **Request Body JSON Schema** | `schema` | No | The JSON schema that describes the properties and values in the incoming request body. The designer uses this schema to generate tokens for the properties in the request. That way, your workflow can parse, consume, and pass along outputs from the **Request** trigger into your workflow. <br><br>If you don't have a JSON schema, you can generate the schema from a sample payload by using the **Use sample payload to generate schema** capability. |

   The following example shows a sample JSON schema:

      "properties": {
         "account": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
               "name": {
                  "type": "string"
               },
               "ID": {
                  "type": "string"
               },
               "address": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                     "number": {
                        "type": "string"
                     },
                     "street": {
                        "type": "string"
                     },
                     "city": {
                        "type": "string"
                     },
                     "state": {
                        "type": "string"
                     },
                     "country": {
                        "type": "string"
                     },
                     "postalCode": {
                        "type": "string"
                     }
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   When you enter a JSON schema, the designer might show a reminder to include the `Content-Type` header in your request and set that header value to `application/json`. For more information, see [Handle content types](../logic-apps/logic-apps-content-type.md).

   The following example shows how the `Content-Type` header appears in JSON format:

   ```json
   {

   ```

   To generate a JSON schema that's based on the expected payload (data), you can use a tool such as [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org), or you can follow these steps:

   1. In the **Request** trigger, select **Use sample payload to generate schema**.

               "postalCode": "11111"
            }
         }
      }
      ```

1. To check that the inbound call has a request body that matches your specified schema, follow these steps:

   1. To enforce the inbound message to have the same exact fields that your schema describes, in your schema, add the `required` property and specify the required fields. Add the `additionalProperties` property, and set the value to *false*.

      For example, the following schema specifies that the inbound message must have the `msg` field and not any other fields:

      ```json
      {
         "properties": {
           "msg": {
              "type": "string"
           }
         },
         "type": "object",
         "required": ["msg"],
         "additionalProperties": false
      }
      ```

   1. On the designer, select the Request trigger. On the information pane that opens, select the **Settings** tab.

   1. Expand **Data Handling**, and set **Schema Validation** to **On**.

      If the inbound call's request body doesn't match your schema, the trigger returns an **HTTP 400 Bad Request** error.

1. From the **Method** list, select the method that the trigger expects inbound requests to use.

1. When you're ready, save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   This step generates the URL that you can use to send a request that triggers the workflow.

1. To copy the generated URL, select the copy icon next to the URL.

   > If you want to include the hash or pound symbol (**#**) in the URI
   > when making a call to the Request trigger, use this encoded version instead: `%25%23`
   >
   > The URL for the Request trigger is associated with your workflow's storage account. This URL 
   > changes if the storage account changes. For example, with Standard logic apps, if you manually 
   > change your storage account and copy your workflow to the new storage account, the URL for 
   > the Request trigger also changes to reflect the new storage account. The same workflow has a different URL.

### Schema validation for stateless workflows

To enable schema validation for stateless workflows, make sure that the **host.json** file in the logic app resource or project has the following [host setting](../logic-apps/edit-app-settings-host-settings.md#manage-host-settings---hostjson):

```json
"extensions": {
   "workflow": {
      "Settings": {
         "Runtime.StatelessFlowEvaluateTriggerCondition": "true"
      }
   }
}
```
---

Now, continue building your workflow by adding another action as the next step. For example, you can respond to the request by [adding a Response action](#add-response), which you can use to return a customized response and is described later in this article.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Your workflow keeps an inbound request open only for a [limited time](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#http-limits). 
> Assuming that your workflow also includes a Response action, if your workflow doesn't return a response to the caller 
> after this time expires, your workflow returns the **504 GATEWAY TIMEOUT** status to the caller. If your workflow 
> doesn't include a Response action, your workflow immediately returns the **202 ACCEPTED** status to the caller.

For information about security, authentication, and encryption for inbound calls to your workflow, such as [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), [OAuth with Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/architecture/auth-oauth2), [Shared Access Signatures (SAS)](../logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md#sas), exposing your logic app resource with Azure API Management, or restricting the IP addresses that originate inbound calls, see [Access for inbound calls to request-based triggers](../logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md#secure-inbound-requests).

## Trigger outputs

The following table lists the outputs from the Request trigger:

| JSON property name | Data type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `headers` | Object | A JSON object that describes the headers from the request |
| `body` | Object | A JSON object that describes the body content from the request |

<a name="add-response"></a>

## Add a Response action

When you use the **Request** trigger to receive inbound requests, you can model the response and send the payload results back to the caller by using the **Response** built-in action, which works *only* with the **Request** trigger. This combination with the **Request** trigger and **Response** action creates the [request-response pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response). Except for inside **For each** loops and **Until** loops, and parallel branches, you can add the **Response** action anywhere in your workflow.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * If your **Response** action includes the following headers, Azure Logic Apps automatically 
> removes these headers from the generated response message without showing any warning 
> or error. Azure Logic Apps doesn't include these headers, although the service won't 
> stop you from saving workflows that have a Response action with these headers.
>
>   * `Allow`
>   * `Content-*` headers except for `Content-Disposition`, `Content-Encoding`, and `Content-Type` when you use `POST` and `PUT` operations, but aren't included for `GET` operations
>   * `Cookie`
>   * `Expires`
>   * `Last-Modified`
>   * `Set-Cookie`
>   * `Transfer-Encoding`
>
> * If you have one or more Response actions in a complex workflow with branches, make sure that the workflow 
> processes at least one Response action during runtime. Otherwise, if all Response actions are skipped, 
> the caller receives a **502 Bad Gateway** error, even if the workflow finishes successfully.
>
> * In a Standard logic app *stateless* workflow, the Response action must appear last in your workflow. If the action appears 
> anywhere else, Azure Logic Apps still won't run the action until all other actions finish running.

## [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Consumption logic app resource.

1. On the sidebar menu, under **Development Tools**, select the designer to open the workflow.

   This example workflow uses the **Request** trigger added in the previous section.

1. Add the **Response** built-in action to your workflow by following the [general steps to add an action](../logic-apps/add-trigger-action-workflow.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. In the action information box, add the required values for the response message.

   | Property name | JSON property name | Required | Description |
   |---------------|--------------------|----------|-------------|
   | **Status Code** | `statusCode` | Yes | The status code to return in the response |
   | **Headers** | `headers` | No | A JSON object that describes one or more headers to include in the response |
   | **Body** | `body` | No | The response body |

   When you select inside any text fields, you get the options to open the dynamic content list (lightning icon) or the expression editor (function icon). When you choose the dynamic content list, you can select outputs that are available from earlier steps in the workflow. If you specified a schema in the **Request** trigger, the schema properties also appear in the dynamic content list and are available for you to use in your workflow.

   For example, in the **Headers** field, use **Content-Type** as the key name, and set the key value to **application/json** as mentioned earlier in this article. For the **Body** box, you can open the dynamic content list, and select the trigger body output.

1. If any other parameters exist for the action, open the **Advanced parameters** list, and select the parameters that you want.

1. When you're done, save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

## [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the resource sidebar menu, under **Workflows**, select **Workflows**, and then select your workflow.
	
1. On the workflow sidebar menu, under **Tools**, select the designer to open the workflow.

   This example workflow uses the **Request** trigger added in the previous section.

1. Add the **Response** built-in action to your workflow by following the [general steps to add an action](../logic-apps/add-trigger-action-workflow.md?tabs=standard#add-action).

1. In the action information box, add the required values for the response message:

   | Property name | JSON property name | Required | Description |
   |---------------|--------------------|----------|-------------|
   | **Status Code** | `statusCode` | Yes | The status code to return in the response |
   | **Headers** | `headers` | No | A JSON object that describes one or more headers to include in the response |
   | **Body** | `body` | No | The response body |

   When you select inside any text fields, you get the options to open the dynamic content list (lightning icon) or the expression editor (function icon). When you choose the dynamic content list, you can select outputs that are available from earlier steps in the workflow. If you specified a schema in the **Request** trigger, the schema properties also appear in the dynamic content list and are available for you to use in your workflow.

   For example, in the **Headers** field, use **Content-Type** as the key name, and set the key value to **application/json** as mentioned earlier in this article. For the **Body** box, you can open the dynamic content list, and select the trigger body output.

   To view the headers in JSON format, select **Switch to text view**.

1. If any other parameters exist for the action, open the **Advanced parameters** list, and select the parameters that you want.

1. When you're done, save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

## Test your workflow

To trigger your workflow, send an HTTP request to the URL generated for the Request trigger, including the method that the Request trigger expects, by using your HTTP request tool and its instructions.

For more information about the trigger's underlying JSON definition and how to call this trigger, see these articles: [Request trigger type](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#request-trigger) and [Call, trigger, or nest workflows with HTTP endpoints in Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-http-endpoint.md).

## Security and authentication

In a Standard logic app workflow that starts with the Request trigger (but not a webhook trigger), you can use the Azure Functions provision for authenticating inbound calls sent to the endpoint created by that trigger by using a managed identity. This provision is also known as *Easy Auth*. For more information, see [Trigger workflows in Standard logic apps with Easy Auth](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/integrations-on-azure-blog/trigger-workflows-in-standard-logic-apps-with-easy-auth/ba-p/3207378).

For more information about security, authorization, and encryption for inbound calls to your logic app workflow, such as [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), [Microsoft Entra ID Open Authentication (Microsoft Entra ID OAuth)](../active-directory/develop/index.yml), exposing your logic app with Azure API Management, or restricting the IP addresses that originate inbound calls, see [Access for inbound calls to request-based triggers](../logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md#secure-inbound-requests).
