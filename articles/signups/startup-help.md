# Startup support and troubleshooting

Azure support and Microsoft Q&A are your go-to resources for troubleshooting issues when using your startup credits. Use these resources for break-fix support or to get answers to specific questions about Azure services.

## Azure support

Your startup credit offer includes a [Basic support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/) for your Azure Sponsorship subscription. This plan provides billing and subscription management support at no extra cost via the Azure portal.

## Microsoft Q&A

Find answers to your Azure-related questions on [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/tags/133/azure), a trusted platform for technical discussions on Azure services. Browse existing answers to see if your question has already been addressed or ask a new question to get guidance from Azure engineers and Community Champions.

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I ask a question on Microsoft Q&A?

To ask a question, sign in to Microsoft Learn with the account linked to your Azure Sponsorship subscription, then choose "Ask a question" and post your question on [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/tags/133/azure).

### How do I create a support request?

To create a support request, go to [Help + support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2201834) in the Azure portal. For detailed instructions, see [how to create an Azure support request](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).

### I'm having trouble redeeming my startup credits. How do I get support if I don't have an Azure subscription yet?

You can create a subscription management support request in the Azure portal even if your subscription hasn't yet been created.

### How do I get technical support?

Technical support is provided through a paid Azure support plan. [Compare Azure support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/). Azure support plans aren't covered by your startup credits.

### Where can I find Azure documentation and learning resources?

Find Azure documentation, example code, tutorials, and more on [Microsoft Learn](/azure/).
