# Two ways to build Your startup with Microsoft

Microsoft supports startups at different stages of their journey in two distinct ways:

- Azure startup credit offer - A fixed Azure credit offer for eligible unincorporated startups and individual founders looking to explore Azure services and start building.
- Microsoft for Startups - A comprehensive program for startups that are incorporated or registered as a legal entity and are ready to build, scale, and grow. In addition to Azure credits, Microsoft for startups offers dedicated support and discounted first- and third-party products and services.

These two paths are designed to make accessing Azure credits and resources easier, no matter how you get started.
