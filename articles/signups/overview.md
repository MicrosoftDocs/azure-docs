# Get up to $5,000 in Azure credits to build and grow your startup

Microsoft is here to support your startup from idea to scale. Get started with $1,000 USD in Azure credits–no application needed. Then, verify your startup to unlock up to $5,000 USD in credits to keep building and growing on Azure.

## Step 1: Redeem $1,000 in Azure credits

Eligible startups can receive $1,000 USD in Azure credits to explore AI models and start building on Azure. Startup credits are valid for 90 days from the date of redemption and can be used toward [eligible Azure products](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/).

### How to get started

1. Go to microsoft.com/startups.
2. Sign in with your personal Microsoft Account (MSA).
1. Set up your Azure account to redeem the credits. Your credits are automatically applied to your new Azure Sponsorship subscription.

You have 90 days to use your credits. Your subscription automatically converts to pay-as-you-go once your startup credit is fully used, or 90 days have passed, whichever comes first.

### Eligibility requirements

To qualify for the $1,000 startup credit offer:

- You must be a new Azure customer with no prior Azure account.
- You must sign in using a valid personal Microsoft Account (MSA).
- You must be in a country/region where this Azure offer is available.

## Step 2: Unlock up to $5,000 with business verification

After redeeming the initial $1,000 credit, eligible startups can unlock up to $5,000 USD in Azure credits by completing business verification. These credits are valid for 180 days from the date your verification is approved.

### How to verify your startup

From the Azure portal, follow the prompts to:

- Confirm your business address
- Provide business registration details
- Share a brief description of your startup

Verification may take up to seven business days. To check your status, go to the Azure portal and select "Check verification status" from the homepage.

Once verified, the additional credits are applied automatically to your Azure account. You have 180 days to use your startup credits. Your subscription automatically converts to pay-as-you-go after the 180-day period or once credits are exhausted.

### Additional eligibility requirements

To qualify for up to $5,000 in Azure credits:

- You must have redeemed the initial $1,000 startup credit.

- Your startup must be a registered legal business entity.
- Verification must be completed within 90 days of initial redemption.
- You must develop and own a software-based product or service. The software must not be licensed from another party.
- You must not be a government agency, educational institution, consultancy, agency, development shop, personal blog, or crypto mining operation.

## Terms and conditions

By redeeming and using Azure startup credits, you agree to the [Azure Service Agreement & Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/) and the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://www.microsoft.com/privacy/privacystatement). Learn more about the [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship Offer Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0036p/).

Startup credits cannot be used for Microsoft Azure support plans, third-party branded products, products sold through Microsoft Azure Marketplace, or products otherwise sold separately from Microsoft Azure. Additionally, startup credits cannot be combined with other licensing, prepaid, or credit offers.

By redeeming startup credits, you agree not to facilitate, engage in, or participate in any use of Azure services for crypto currency mining, denial of service attacks, spamming, or illegal activity, and/or any use that could cause harm to Microsoft or others, and will enforce strong internal controls to prevent the same. If Microsoft believes for any reason that such Azure services are being used for any prohibited purpose, Microsoft may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your access to the Azure services.

## Frequently asked questions

### I'm seeing an eligibility error. What should I do? 

The startup credit offer is only available for new Azure customers using a personal Microsoft Account (MSA). If you see an error: 

- Confirm you’re signed in with an MSA. If signed in with a work or school account, sign out and switch to an MSA.
- Ensure you don’t have an existing Azure subscription. If you do, you aren't eligible for the startup credit offer.
### Why do I need a credit card to redeem my startup credit offer?

Your credit card is required to:

- Verify your identity.
- Pay for services not covered by your startup credits. See [which Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/) are included.
- Ensure a seamless transition to pay-as-you-go.

If you're having trouble, learn how to [troubleshoot credit card issues](/azure/cost-management-billing/troubleshoot-billing/troubleshoot-declined-card).

### Why is business verification required to get more credits?

Verification confirms your eligibility and helps prevent fraudulent use of the startup credits. Verification can only be submitted once per startup, so ensure all your information is complete and accurate before submitting.

### I don't see the option to verify. What now?

If you're not seeing the option to verify, make sure that:

- You've redeemed the initial $1,000 credit.
- You're within the 90-day window for verification.
- Your startup hasn’t already been verified or denied.

### What if my business can't be verified?

You can continue using the $1,000 startup credit but are not eligible for additional credits.

### What happens when my startup credits run out or expire?

Your subscription automatically converts to pay-as-you-go. There’s no upfront commitment, and you can [cancel your subscription](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription) at any time.

### Can I request more time to use my startup credits?

No, any unused credits expire 90 days after initial redemption or 180 days after successful verification. Expiration periods can't be extended.

### Can I transfer my startup credits to a different Microsoft Account (MSA)?

No, startup credits can’t be transferred between accounts. Once your credits are activated, they’re tied to the MSA you used during redemption.

### Can I apply my startup credits to multiple accounts?

No, startup credits can't be shared or merged with multiple accounts.

### How can I get more Azure credits?

If your startup is affiliated with the Microsoft for Startups Investor Network, you may be eligible for a higher level of support from Microsoft for Startups. This includes enhanced benefits, increased Azure credits, access to advanced AI services, expert technical guidance, and go-to-market support–all designed to help you build faster, scale smarter, and reach more customers.
