Learn more about the [Azure sponsorship offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0036p/) and review the [Azure Service Agreement & Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/).

## Exclusions

The startup credit offer cannot be used for Microsoft Azure support plans, third-party branded products, products sold through Microsoft Azure Marketplace, or products otherwise sold separately from Microsoft Azure. Additionally, startup credits cannot be combined with other licensing, prepaid, or credit offers.

By redeeming the startup credit offer, you agree not to facilitate, engage in, or participate in any use of Azure services for crypto currency mining, denial of service attacks, spamming, or illegal activity, and/or any use that could cause harm to Microsoft or others, and will enforce strong internal controls to prevent the same. If Microsoft believes for any reason that such Azure services are being used for any prohibited purpose, Microsoft may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your access to the Azure services.

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I redeem my startup credit offer?

Get started at [microsoft.com/startups](https://microsoft.com/startups). Sign in with your personal Microsoft Account (MSA) to redeem the $1,000 startup credit offer for eligible startups directly in the Azure portal. Once you sign up, your credits are automatically applied to your Azure Sponsorship subscription. You can start using your credits immediately for eligible Azure services.

### Why do I need a credit card to redeem my startup credit offer?

Your credit card is required for:

- Verifying your identity.
- Paying for services not covered by your startup credits. See [which Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/) are included.
- Ensuring a seamless transition to pay-as-you-go when your startup credits expire.

### How do I resolve Azure activation errors related to my credit card?

Learn how to [troubleshoot credit card issues](/azure/cost-management-billing/troubleshoot-billing/troubleshoot-declined-card).

### I signed in but I'm seeing an error about my eligibility. What should I do?

The startup credit offer is only available for new Azure customers using a personal Microsoft Account (MSA). If you see an eligibility error:

- Check your account type. If signed in with a work or school account, sign out and switch to an MSA.
- Check your Azure account. If you have an existing Azure subscription, you aren't eligible for the startup credit offer.
- Continue without credits. Explore relevant services and AI templates to build your startup on Azure.

### How long do I have to use my startup credit offer?

You have 90 days after activating your startup credit offer to use your credits. Any unused credits will expire after 90 days.

### What happens when my $1,000 startup credit runs out or expires?

Your Azure Sponsorship subscription will automatically convert to pay-as-you-go once your $1,000 startup credit is fully used or 90 days have passed, whichever comes first. You'll only pay for what you use while continuing to access [65+ free services](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=payg#free-services). There's no upfront commitment, and you can [cancel your subscription](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription) at any time.

### Can I request more time to use my startup credit offer?

No, any unused credits will expire after 90 days.

### How can I get more Azure credits?

Startups that are incorporated or registered as a legal entity are invited to [join Microsoft for Startups](/microsoft-for-startups/) to receive Azure credits, dedicated support, and discounted first- and third-party products and services.

### Can I transfer my startup credits to a different Microsoft Account (MSA)?

No, startup credits can’t be transferred between accounts. Once your credits are activated, they’re tied to the MSA you used during redemption and can’t be moved to another account.

### Can I apply my startup credits to multiple accounts?

No, Azure benefits are applied on an account level and can't be shared or merged with multiple accounts.

### I'm seeing the startup homepage but prefer the default view. How can I switch?

The startup homepage is designed to help founders quickly discover and develop AI solutions. To switch to the default view, go to the Azure portal settings > Appearance, and set the Homepage type to Home (preview). You can also toggle off the new Azure experience from the homepage to access other views.


### How can I get help accessing my Microsoft Account (MSA)?

See the [Microsoft Account troubleshooting guide](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/i-can-t-sign-in-to-my-microsoft-account-475c9b5c-8c25-49f1-9c2d-c64b7072e735) for sign-in help.
