# Azure Content Delivery Network
When using Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet) for websites or mobile apps that involve streaming media, gaming software, firmware updates (for example, smart TVs and consumer electronic appliances), or Internet of Things (IoT) endpoints (such as cars and sensors), the Content Delivery Network (CDN) can help you reduce load times, save bandwidth, and increase responsiveness.

Local providers offer the CDN service in China. (By comparison, the [Azure CDN](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cdn-overview/) service for global Azure offers choices from Microsoft, Verizon, and Akamai.) Currently, six local CDN providers are available, including Webluker from ChinaCache, [ChineNetCenter](http://www.chinanetcenter.com/), [Fastweb](http://www.fastweb.com.cn/), and more in the future.

To work with the Azure CDN service: 
- [Get support from 21Vianet](/azure/china/china-resources-support), the single point of contact for all Azure services, including Azure CDN.
- Log on at the Azure [unified CDN management portal](https://www.azure.cn/documentation/articles/cdn-management-portal-how-to-use/) (not the global Azure CDN portal you may have used).
