# Learning Guide: Advanced data processing in Azure 

This map walks through the process of preparing data to be used in an Azure Machine Learning experiment. It shows how to move, process, and sample data to prepare it for machine learning. The data preparation process described here is a step in the map provided in the [Advanced Analytics Process and Technology guide for Azure Machine Learning](./machine-learning-data-science-how-to-create-machine-learning-service.md)
