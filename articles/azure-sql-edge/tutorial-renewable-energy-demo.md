# Use Azure SQL Edge to build smarter renewable resources

[!INCLUDE [retirement-notice](includes/retirement-notice.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> Azure SQL Edge no longer supports the ARM64 platform.

The [Wind Turbine Demo](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/demos/azure-sql-edge-demos/Wind%20Turbine%20Demo) for Azure SQL Edge is based on Contoso Renewable Energy, a wind turbine farm that uses SQL Edge for data processing onboard the generator.

This demo walks you through resolving an alert being raised because of wind turbulence being detected at the device. You'll train a model and deploy it to SQL Edge, which corrects the detected wind wake and ultimately optimizes power output.
