DxOdyssey for IoT extends this to edge devices, allowing seamless access from the edge devices to the data center and cloud. This SDP module runs on any IoT device in a container on x64 and ARM64 architecture. Once enabled, organizations can create secure, private application-level tunnels between devices and hubs without the requirement of a VPN or exposing public, open ports. This SDP module is purpose-built for IoT use cases where edge devices must communicate with any other devices, resources, applications, or clouds. Minimum hardware requirements: Linux x64 and ARM64 OS, 1 GB of RAM, 100 MB of storage| [Website](https://dh2i.com/) [Marketplace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/MarketplaceOffersBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home) [Documentation](https://dh2i.com/dxodyssey-for-iot/) [Support](https://support.dh2i.com/)
