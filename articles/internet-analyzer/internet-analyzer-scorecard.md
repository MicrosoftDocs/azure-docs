# Interpreting your scorecard

The scorecard tab contains the aggregated and analyzed results from all of your tests. Each test has its own scorecard. Scorecards are designed to help you inform your network topology decisions with data. Internet Analyzer takes care of the analysis, allowing you to focus on the decision. 

The scorecard tab can be found in the Internet Analyzer resource menu. 


# Scorecard Components 

## Filters: 
* ***Test:*** Select the test that you’d like to view results for - each test has its own scorecard. Test data will appear once there is enough data to complete the analysis – in most cases, this should be within 24 hours. 
* ***Time period & end date:*** Three scorecards are generated daily – each scorecard reflects a different aggregation period – that day, the seven days prior (week), and the 30 days prior (month). Use the “End Date” filter to select the last day of the time period you want to see. 
* ***Country:*** For each country that you have end users, a scorecard is generated. The global filter is representative of all your end users.
