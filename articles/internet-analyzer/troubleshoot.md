# Azure Internet Analyzer troubleshooting

This article contains troubleshooting steps for common Internet Analyzer issues.

## Azure Portal
**"Not enough measurements have been collected for this scorecard" in the Scorecards section**

Note that:
- The client script must be embedded into an **HTTPS** website. Measurements won't be collected if the script runs in a plaintext (**http://**) or local (**file://**) website.
- Measurement data will only be collected if the Internet Analyzer profile's client script has been embedded into an application that is receiving real user traffic. Synthetic traffic (for example, Azure WebApp Performance Tests) does not typically execute embedded Javascript code, so no measurements will be generated by that type of traffic.
- Time series are generated once an hour, so you’ll need to wait at least that amount of time for new measurement data to show up.
- Scorecards are generated on a daily basis (at the end of every day, UTC time).
- Scorecards are only generated if more than 100 measurements were collected for the selected filter combination (Test, Time Period, Country, etc.).
