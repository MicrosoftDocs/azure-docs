# Embed the Internet Analyzer client

This article shows you how to embed the JavaScript client in your application. Installation of this client is necessary to run tests and receive scorecard analytics. While no tests will begin until the client is embedded, you can embed it either before or after configuring any test(s). For more information on Internet Analyzer, see the [overview](internet-analyzer-overview.md).
