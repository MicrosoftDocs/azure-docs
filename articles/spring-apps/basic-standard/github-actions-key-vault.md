# Authenticate Azure Spring Apps with Azure Key Vault in GitHub Actions

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ✅ Java ✅ C#

**This article applies to:** ✅ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

This article shows you how to use Key Vault with a CI/CD workflow for Azure Spring Apps with GitHub Actions.

Key vault is a secure place to store keys. Enterprise users need to store credentials for CI/CD environments in scope that they control. The key to get credentials in the key vault should be limited to resource scope. It has access to only the key vault scope, not the entire Azure scope. It's like a key that can only open a strong box not a master key that can open all doors in a building. It's a way to get a key with another key, which is useful in a CICD workflow.

## Generate Credential

To generate a key to access the key vault, execute command below on your local machine:

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<KEY_VAULT> --json-auth
```

The scope specified by the `--scopes` parameter limits the key access to the resource.  It can only access the strong box.

With results:

```output
{
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
    "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
    "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
    "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
    "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
```

Then save the results to GitHub **secrets** as described in [Set up your GitHub repository and authenticate with Azure](./how-to-github-actions.md#set-up-github-repository-and-authenticate).

## Add Access Policies for the Credential

The credential you created above can get only general information about the Key Vault, not the contents it stores.  To get secrets stored in the Key Vault, you need set access policies for the credential.

Go to the **Key Vault** dashboard in Azure portal, select the **Access control** menu, then open the **Role assignments** tab. Select **Apps** for **Type** and `This resource` for **scope**.  You should see the credential you created in previous step:

Copy the credential name, for example, `azure-cli-2020-01-19-04-39-02`. Open the **Access policies** menu, then select the **Add Access Policy** link.  Select `Secret Management` for **Template**, then select **Principal**. Paste the credential name in **Principal**/**Select** input box:

Select the **Add** button in the **Add access policy** dialog, then select **Save**.

## Generate full-scope Azure Credential

This is the master key to open all doors in the building. The procedure is similar to the previous step, but here we change the scope to generate the master key:

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID> --json-auth
```

Again, results:

```output
{
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
    "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
    "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
    "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
    "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
```

Copy the entire JSON string.  Go back to **Key Vault** dashboard. Open the **Secrets** menu, then select the **Generate/Import** button. Input the secret name, such as `AZURE-CREDENTIALS-FOR-SPRING`. Paste the JSON credential string to the **Value** input box. You may notice the value input box is a one-line text field, rather than a multi-line text area.  You can paste the complete JSON string there.

## Combine credentials in GitHub Actions

Set the credentials used when the CICD pipeline executes:

```console
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}           # Strong box key you generated in the first step
    - uses: Azure/get-keyvault-secrets@v1.0
      with:
        keyvault: "<Your Key Vault Name>"
        secrets: "AZURE-CREDENTIALS-FOR-SPRING"           # Master key to open all doors in the building
      id: keyvaultaction
    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ steps.keyvaultaction.outputs.AZURE-CREDENTIALS-FOR-SPRING }}
    - name: Azure CLI script
      uses: azure/CLI@v1
      with:
        azcliversion: 2.0.75
        inlineScript: |
          az extension add --name spring             # Spring CLI commands from here
          az spring list

```
