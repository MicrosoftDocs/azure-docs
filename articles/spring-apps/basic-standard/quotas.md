<sup>1</sup> You can increase this limit via support request to a maximum of 1 per app.

<sup>2</sup> You can increase this limit via support request to a maximum of 10.

<sup>3</sup> This limit only applies to customers without an Enterprise Agreement subscription. You can increase this limit based on your workload size via raising a support ticket. For customers with an Enterprise Agreement subscription, Azure Spring Apps automatically adjusts underlying resource to support application traffic.

> [!TIP]
> Limits listed apply for apps and deployments in any state, including apps in a stopped state. These limits include total app instances and per service instances. Be sure to delete apps and deployments that aren't being used.

## Next steps

Some default limits can be increased. For more information, see [create a support request](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).
