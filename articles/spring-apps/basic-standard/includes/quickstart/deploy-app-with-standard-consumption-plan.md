<!--
For clarity of structure, a separate markdown file is used to describe how to deploy to Azure Spring Apps with standard consumption plan.

[!INCLUDE [deploy-app-with-standard-consumption-plan](includes/quickstart/deploy-app-with-standard-consumption-plan.md)]

-->

## 2. Prepare the Spring project

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

The **Deploy to Azure** button in the next section launches an Azure portal experience that downloads a JAR package from the [spring-cloud-azure-tools releases](https://github.com/Azure/spring-cloud-azure-tools/releases) page on GitHub. No local preparation steps are needed.

### [Azure portal + Maven plugin](#tab/Azure-portal-maven-plugin)

[!INCLUDE [prepare-spring-project](prepare-spring-project.md)]

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

Use the following steps to initialize the application from the Azure Developer CLI templates:

1. Open a terminal, create an empty folder, and then change directory into it.

1. Use the following command to initialize the project:

   ```bash
   azd init --template spring-guides/gs-spring-boot-for-azure
   ```

   The following list describes the command interactions:

   - **OAuth2 login**: You need to authorize the sign in to Azure based on the OAuth2 protocol.
   - **Please enter a new environment name**: Provide an environment name, which is used as a suffix for the resource group created to hold all Azure resources. This name should be unique within your Azure subscription.

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Initializing a new project (azd init)

   (✓) Done: Initialized git repository
   (✓) Done: Downloading template code to: <your-local-path>
   Enter a new environment name: <your-env-name>
   SUCCESS: New project initialized!
   You can view the template code in your directory: <your-local-path>

   ```

## 3. Prepare the cloud environment

This section describes how to create an Azure Spring Apps service instance and prepare the Azure cloud environment.

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

[!INCLUDE [hello-prepare-cloud-environment-consumption-azure-portal](hello-prepare-cloud-environment-consumption-azure-portal.md)]

### [Azure portal + Maven plugin](#tab/Azure-portal-maven-plugin)

### 3.1. Sign in to the Azure portal

Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and enter your credentials to sign in to the portal. The default view is your service dashboard.

### 3.2. Create an Azure Spring Apps instance

[!INCLUDE [provision-consumption-azure-spring-apps](provision-consumption-azure-spring-apps.md)]

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

Use the following steps to create the required resources:

1. Use the following command to sign in to Azure with OAuth2. Ignore this step if you already signed in.

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```text
   Logged in to Azure.
   ```

1. Use the following command to provision the template's infrastructure to Azure:

   ```bash
   azd provision
   ```

   The following list describes the command interactions:

   - **Select an Azure Subscription to use**: Use arrows to move, type to filter, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
   - **Select an Azure location to use**: Use arrows to move, type to filter, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```text
   SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned in Azure in xx minutes xx seconds.
   You can view the resources created under the resource group rg-<your-environment-name>-<random-string>> in Azure Portal:
   https://portal.azure.com/#@/resource/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/rg-<your-environment-name>/overview
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This may take a while to complete. You will see a progress indicator as it provisions Azure resources.

## 4. Deploy the app to Azure Spring Apps

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

[!INCLUDE [deploy-hello-app-azure-portal](deploy-hello-app-azure-portal.md)]

### [Azure portal + Maven plugin](#tab/Azure-portal-maven-plugin)

[!INCLUDE [deploy-spring-apps-maven-plugin](hello-spring-apps-maven-plugin.md)]

2. Use the following command to deploy the app:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw azure-spring-apps:deploy
   ```

   The following list describes the command interaction:

   - **OAuth2 login**: You need to authorize the sign in to Azure based on the OAuth2 protocol.

   After the command is executed, you can see from the following log messages that the deployment was successful:

   ```output
   [INFO] Deployment(default) is successfully created
   [INFO] Starting Spring App after deploying artifacts...
   [INFO] Deployment Status: Running
   [INFO]   InstanceName:demo--default-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx  Status:Running Reason:null       DiscoverStatus:NONE
   [INFO] Getting public url of app(demo)...
   [INFO] Application url: https://demo.<unique-identifier>.<region-name>.azurecontainerapps.io
   ```

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

Use the following steps to package the app, provision the Azure resources required by the web application, and then deploy to Azure Spring Apps:

1. Use the following command to package a deployable copy of your application:

   ```bash
   azd package
   ```

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   SUCCESS: Your application was packaged for Azure in xx seconds.
   ```

1. Use the following command to deploy the application code to those newly provisioned resources:

   ```bash
   azd deploy
   ```

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Deploying services (azd deploy)

   (✓) Done: Deploying service demo
   - Endpoint: https://demo.xxx.<your-azure-location>.azurecontainerapps.io


   SUCCESS: Your application was deployed to Azure in xx minutes xx seconds.
   You can view the resources created under the resource group rg-<your-environment-name> in Azure Portal:
   https://portal.azure.com/#@/resource/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/rg-<your-environment-name>/overview
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use `azd up` to combine the previous three commands: `azd provision` (provisions Azure resources), `azd package` (packages a deployable copy of your application), and `azd deploy` (deploys application code). For more information, see [spring-guides/gs-spring-boot-for-azure](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot-for-azure).
