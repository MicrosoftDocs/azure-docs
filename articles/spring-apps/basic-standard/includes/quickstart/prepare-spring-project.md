Use the following steps to prepare the project:

1. Use the following command to clone the [Spring Boot sample project for Azure](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot-for-azure.git) from GitHub.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot-for-azure.git
   ```

1. Use the following command to move to the project folder:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   cd gs-spring-boot-for-azure/complete
   ```

1. Use the following [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) command to build the project:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   ./mvnw clean package
   ```

1. Run the sample project locally by using the following command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
