```bash
azd down
```

The following list describes the command interactions:

- **Total resources to delete: \<your-resources-total>, are you sure you want to continue?**: Press <kbd>y</kbd>.
- **Would you like to permanently delete these resources instead, allowing their names to be reused?**: Press <kbd>y</kbd>. Press <kbd>n</kbd> if you want to reuse the Key Vault.

The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

```output
SUCCESS: Your application was removed from Azure in xx minutes xx seconds.
