For clarity of structure, a separate markdown file is used to describe how to clean up Azure resource via resource group.

[!INCLUDE [clean-up-resources-via-resource-group](../../includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/clean-up-resources-via-resource-group.md)]

-->

Use the following steps to delete the entire resource group, including the newly created service instance:

1. Locate your resource group in the Azure portal. On the navigation menu, select **Resource groups**, and then select the name of your resource group.

1. On the **Resource group** page, select **Delete**. Enter the name of your resource group in the text box to confirm deletion, then select **Delete**.
