<!--
For clarity of structure, a separate markdown file is used to describe how to deploy to Azure Spring Apps with standard plan.

[!INCLUDE [deploy-to-azure-spring-apps-standard-plan](includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/deploy-standard-plan.md)]

-->

## 2. Prepare the Spring project

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

The **Deploy to Azure** button in the next section launches an Azure portal experience that downloads a JAR package from the [ASA-Samples-Web-Application releases](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Web-Application/releases) page on GitHub. No local preparation steps are needed.

### [Azure portal + Maven plugin](#tab/Azure-portal-maven-plugin)

Although you use the Azure portal in later steps, you must use the Bash command line to prepare the project locally. Use the following steps to clone and run the app locally:

[!INCLUDE [prepare-project-on-azure-portal](../../includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/prepare-web-project.md)]

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

Use the following steps to initialize the web application from the Azure Developer CLI templates:

1. Open a terminal, create an empty folder, and then change directory into it.

1. Use the following command to initialize the project:

   ```bash
   azd init --template https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Web-Application
   ```

   The following list describes the command interaction:

   - **Enter a new environment name**: Provide an environment name, which is used as a suffix for the resource group created to hold all the Azure resources. This name should be unique within your Azure subscription.

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Initializing a new project (azd init)
   (✓) Done: Initialized git repository
   (✓) Done: Downloading template code to: <your-local-path>

   Please enter a new environment name: <your-env-name>

   SUCCESS: New project initialized!
   You can view the template code in your directory: <your-local-path>

## 4. Deploy the app to Azure Spring Apps

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

[!INCLUDE [deploy-web-app-on-azure-portal](../../includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/deploy-web-app-azure-portal.md)]

### [Azure portal + Maven plugin](#tab/Azure-portal-maven-plugin)

You can now deploy the app to Azure Spring Apps.

Use the following steps to deploy with the [Maven plugin for Azure Spring Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Azure-Spring-Apps):

1. Navigate to the sample project directory and run the following command to configure the app in Azure Spring Apps:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw com.microsoft.azure:azure-spring-apps-maven-plugin:1.19.0:config
   ```

   The following list describes the command interactions:

   - **Select child modules to configure**: Select the module to configure, then enter the number of the *SimpleTodo Web* module.
   - **OAuth2 login**: Authorize the sign in to Azure based on the OAuth2 protocol.
   - **Select subscription**: Select the subscription list number of the Azure Spring Apps instance you created, which defaults to the first subscription in the list. If you use the default number, press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> directly.
   - **Select Azure Spring Apps**: Select the number of the Azure Spring Apps instance you created. If you use the default number, press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> directly.
   - **Expose public access for this app?**: Press <kbd>y</kbd>.
   - **Confirm to save all the above configurations (Y/n)**: Press <kbd>y</kbd>. If you press <kbd>n</kbd>, the configuration isn't saved in the POM files.

1. Use the following command to deploy the app:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw azure-spring-apps:deploy
   ```

   The following list describes the command interaction:

   - **OAuth2 login**: You need to authorize the sign in to Azure based on the OAuth2 protocol.

   After the command is executed, you can see from the following log messages that the deployment was successful:

   ```output
   [INFO] Deployment(default) is successfully created
   [INFO] Starting Spring App after deploying artifacts...
   [INFO] Deployment Status: Running
   [INFO]   InstanceName:simple-todo-web-default-x-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx  Status:Running Reason:null       DiscoverStatus:UNREGISTERED
   [INFO]   InstanceName:simple-todo-web-default-x-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx  Status:Terminating Reason:null       DiscoverStatus:UNREGISTERED
   [INFO] Getting public url of app(simple-todo-web)...
   [INFO] Application url: https://<your-Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name>-simple-todo-web.azuremicroservices.io
   ```

   The output **Application url** is the endpoint to access the `todo` application.

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

You can now deploy the app to Azure Spring Apps. Use the following steps to package the app, provision the Azure resources required by the web application, and then deploy to Azure Spring Apps:

1. Use the following command to package a deployable copy of your application:

   ```bash
   azd package
   ```

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   SUCCESS: Your application was packaged for Azure in xx seconds.
   ```

1. Use the following command to deploy the application code to those newly provisioned resources:

   ```bash
   azd deploy
   ```

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Deploying services (azd deploy)

   (✓) Done: Deploying service simple-todo-web
   - Endpoint: https://<your-Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name>-simple-todo-web.azuremicroservices.io/

   
   SUCCESS: Your application was deployed to Azure in xx minutes xx seconds.
   You can view the resources created under the resource group rg-<your-environment-name> in Azure Portal:
   https://portal.azure.com/#@/resource/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/rg-<your-environment-name>/overview
   ```

   The output **Endpoint** is the endpoint to access the `todo` application.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use `azd up` to combine the previous three commands: `azd package` (packages a deployable copy of your application), `azd provision` (provisions Azure resources), and `azd deploy` (deploys application code). For more information, see [Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Web-Application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Web-Application).
