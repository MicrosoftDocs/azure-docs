<!--
For clarity of structure, a separate markdown file is used to describe how to deploy web app using Azure Portal.

[!INCLUDE [deploy-web-app-on-azure-portal](../../includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/deploy-web-app-azure-portal.md)]

-->

The **Deploy to Azure** button in the previous section launches an Azure portal experience that includes application deployment, so nothing else is needed.
