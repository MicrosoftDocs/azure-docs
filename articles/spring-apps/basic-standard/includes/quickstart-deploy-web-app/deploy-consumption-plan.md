For clarity of structure, a separate markdown file is used to describe how to deploy to Azure Spring Apps consumption plan.

[!INCLUDE [deploy-to-azure-spring-apps-consumption-plan](includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/deploy-consumption-plan.md)]

-->

## 2. Prepare the Spring project

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

The **Deploy to Azure** button in the next section launches an Azure portal experience that downloads a JAR package from the [ASA-Samples-Web-Application releases](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Web-Application/releases) page on GitHub. No local preparation steps are needed.

### [Azure portal + Maven plugin](#tab/Azure-portal-maven-plugin)

Although you use the Azure portal in later steps, you must use the Bash command line to prepare the project locally. Use the following steps to clone and run the app locally:

[!INCLUDE [prepare-project-on-azure-portal](../../includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/prepare-web-project.md)]

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

Use the following steps to initialize the web application from the Azure Developer CLI templates:

1. Open a terminal, create an empty folder, and then change directory into it.

1. Use the following command to initialize the project:

   ```bash
   azd init --template https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Web-Application
   ```

   The following list describes the command interaction:

   - **Enter a new environment name**: Provide an environment name, which is used as a suffix for the resource group created to hold all the Azure resources. This name should be unique within your Azure subscription.

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Initializing a new project (azd init)
   (✓) Done: Initialized git repository
   (✓) Done: Downloading template code to: <your-local-path>

   Enter a new environment name: <your-env-name>

   SUCCESS: New project initialized!
   You can view the template code in your directory: <your-local-path>

## 4. Deploy the app to Azure Spring Apps

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

[!INCLUDE [deploy-web-app-on-azure-portal](../../includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/deploy-web-app-azure-portal.md)]

### [Azure portal + Maven plugin](#tab/Azure-portal-maven-plugin)

[!INCLUDE [web-spring-apps-maven-plugin](web-spring-apps-maven-plugin.md)]

   ```output
   [INFO] Start updating app(simple-todo-web)...
   [INFO] App(simple-todo-web) is successfully updated.
   [INFO] Starting Spring App after deploying artifacts...
   [INFO] Deployment Status: Running
   [INFO]   InstanceName:simple-todo-web--default-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx  Status:Running Reason:null       DiscoverStatus:NONE
   [INFO] Getting public url of app(simple-todo-web)...
   [INFO] Application url: https://simple-todo-web.<unique-identifier>.<region-name>.azurecontainerapps.io
   ```

   The output **Application url** is the endpoint to access the `todo` application.

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

You can now deploy the app to Azure Spring Apps. Use the following steps to package the app, provision the Azure resources required by the web application, and then deploy to Azure Spring Apps:

1. Use the following command to package a deployable copy of your application:

   ```bash
   azd package
   ```

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   SUCCESS: Your application was packaged for Azure in xx seconds.
   ```

1. Use the following command to deploy the application code to those newly provisioned resources:

   ```bash
   azd deploy
   ```

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Deploying services (azd deploy)

   (✓) Done: Deploying service simple-todo-web
   - Endpoint: https://simple-todo-web.xxx.<your-azure-location>.azurecontainerapps.io


   SUCCESS: Your application was deployed to Azure in xx minutes xx seconds.
   You can view the resources created under the resource group rg-<your-environment-name> in Azure Portal:
   https://portal.azure.com/#@/resource/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/rg-<your-environment-name>/overview
   ```

   The output **Endpoint** is the endpoint to access the `todo` application.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use `azd up` to combine the previous three commands: `azd provision` (provisions Azure resources), `azd package` (packages a deployable copy of your application), and `azd deploy` (deploys application code). For more information, see [Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Web-Application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Web-Application).
