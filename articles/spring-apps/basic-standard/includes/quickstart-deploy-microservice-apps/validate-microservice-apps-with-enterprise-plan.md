### 5.2. Query the application logs

After you browse each function of the Pet Clinic, the Log Analytics workspace collects logs of each application. You can check the logs by using custom queries, as shown in the following screenshot:

### 5.3. Monitor the applications

Application Insights monitors the application dependencies, as shown by the following application tracing map:

Open the Application Live View URL exposed by the Developer Tools to monitor application runtimes, as shown in the following screenshot:
