# Use Azure Spring Apps CI/CD with GitHub Actions

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ✅ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

This article shows you how to build up a CI/CD workflow for Azure Spring Apps with GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions support an automated software development lifecycle workflow. With GitHub Actions for Azure Spring Apps you can create workflows in your repository to build, test, package, release, and deploy to Azure.

## Prerequisites

This example requires the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

## Set up GitHub repository and authenticate

You need an Azure service principal credential to authorize Azure login action. To get an Azure credential, execute the following commands on your local machine:

```azurecli
az login
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
    --role contributor \
    --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID> \
    --json-auth
```

To access to a specific resource group, you can reduce the scope:

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
    --role contributor \
    --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP> \
    --json-auth
```

The command should output a JSON object:

```json
{
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    ...
}
```

This example uses the [steeltoe sample on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-spring-apps-samples/tree/main/steeltoe-sample).  Fork the repository, open the GitHub repository page for the fork, and select the **Settings** tab. Open the **Secrets** menu, and select **New secret**:

Set the secret name to `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and its value to the JSON string that you found under the heading *Set up your GitHub repository and authenticate*.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-github-actions/actions2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub Actions secrets / New secret page." lightbox="media/how-to-github-actions/actions2.png":::

You can also get the Azure login credential from Key Vault in GitHub Actions as explained in [Authenticate Azure Spring with Key Vault in GitHub Actions](./github-actions-key-vault.md).

## Provision service instance

To provision your Azure Spring Apps service instance, run the following commands using the Azure CLI.

```azurecli
az extension add --name spring
az group create \
    --name <resource-group-name> \
    --location eastus
az spring create \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <service-instance-name>
az spring config-server git set \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --uri https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-spring-apps-samples \
    --label main \
    --search-paths steeltoe-sample/config
```

## Build the workflow

The workflow is defined using the following options.

### Prepare for deployment with Azure CLI

The command `az spring app create` is currently not idempotent. After you run it once, you get an error if you run the same command again. We recommend this workflow on existing Azure Spring Apps apps and instances.

Use the following Azure CLI commands for preparation:

```azurecli
az config set defaults.group=<service-group-name>
az config set defaults.spring=<service-instance-name>
az spring app create --name planet-weather-provider
az spring app create --name solar-system-weather
```

### Deploy with Azure CLI directly

Create the **.github/workflows/main.yml** file in the repository with the following content. Replace `<your resource group name>` and `<your service name>` with the correct values.

```yaml
name: Steeltoe-CD

# Controls when the action runs. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job runs on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      working-directory: ./steeltoe-sample
      resource-group-name: <your resource group name>
      service-name: <your service name>

    # Supported .NET Core version matrix.
    strategy:
      matrix:
        dotnet: [ '3.1.x' ]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that is executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Set up .NET Core 3.1 SDK
      - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
        with:
          dotnet-version: ${{ matrix.dotnet }}

      # Set credential for az login
      - uses: azure/login@v1.1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: install Azure CLI extension
        run: |
          az extension add --name spring --yes

      - name: Build and package planet-weather-provider app
        working-directory: ${{env.working-directory}}/src/planet-weather-provider
        run: |
          dotnet publish
          az spring app deploy -n planet-weather-provider --runtime-version NetCore_31 --main-entry Microsoft.Azure.SpringCloud.Sample.PlanetWeatherProvider.dll --artifact-path ./publish-deploy-planet.zip -s ${{ env.service-name }} -g ${{ env.resource-group-name }}
      - name: Build solar-system-weather app
        working-directory: ${{env.working-directory}}/src/solar-system-weather
        run: |
          dotnet publish
          az spring app deploy -n solar-system-weather --runtime-version NetCore_31 --main-entry Microsoft.Azure.SpringCloud.Sample.SolarSystemWeather.dll --artifact-path ./publish-deploy-solar.zip -s ${{ env.service-name }} -g ${{ env.resource-group-name }}
```

## Set up GitHub repository and authenticate

You need an Azure service principal credential to authorize Azure login action. To get an Azure credential, execute the following commands on your local machine:

```azurecli
az login
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
    --role contributor \
    --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID> \
    --json-auth
```

To access to a specific resource group, you can reduce the scope:

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
    --role contributor \
    --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP> \
    --json-auth
```

The command should output a JSON object:

```JSON
{
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    ...
}
```

This example uses the [PiggyMetrics](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/piggymetrics) sample on GitHub. Fork the sample, uncheck **Copy the Azure branch only**, open the GitHub repository page, and select the **Settings** tab. Open **Secrets** menu, and select **Add a new secret**:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-github-actions/actions1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub Actions secrets and variables page with the New repository secret button highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-github-actions/actions1.png":::

Set the secret name to `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and its value to the JSON string that you found under the heading *Set up your GitHub repository and authenticate*.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-github-actions/actions2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub Actions secrets / New secret page." lightbox="media/how-to-github-actions/actions2.png":::

You can also get the Azure login credential from Key Vault in GitHub Actions as explained in [Authenticate Azure Spring with Key Vault in GitHub Actions](./github-actions-key-vault.md).

## Provision service instance

To provision your Azure Spring Apps service instance, run the following commands using the Azure CLI.

```azurecli
az extension add --name spring
az group create --location eastus --name <resource group name>
az spring create -n <service instance name> -g <resource group name>
az spring config-server git set -n <service instance name> --uri https://github.com/xxx/piggymetrics --label config
```

## End-to-end sample workflows

The following examples demonstrate common usage scenarios.

### Deploying

The following sections show you various options for deploying your app.

#### To production

Azure Spring Apps supports deploying to deployments with built artifacts (for example, JAR or .NET Core ZIP) or source code archive.

The following example deploys to the default production deployment in Azure Spring Apps using JAR file built by Maven. This example is the only possible deployment scenario when using the Basic SKU:

> [!NOTE]
> The package search pattern should only return exactly one package. If the build task produces multiple JAR packages such as **sources.jar** and **javadoc.jar**, you need to refine the search pattern so that it only matches the application binary artifact.

```yml
name: AzureSpringApps
on: push
env:
  ASC_PACKAGE_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION: <azure subscription name>

jobs:
  deploy_to_production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: deploy to production with artifact
    steps:
      - name: Checkout GitHub Action
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Java 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '11'

      - name: maven build, clean
        run: |
          mvn clean package

      - name: Login via Azure CLI
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: deploy to production with artifact
        uses: azure/spring-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: Deploy
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
          use-staging-deployment: false
          package: ${{ env.ASC_PACKAGE_PATH }}/**/*.jar
```

The following example deploys to the default production deployment in Azure Spring Apps using source code.

```yml
name: AzureSpringApps
on: push
env:
  ASC_PACKAGE_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION: <azure subscription name>

jobs:
  deploy_to_production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: deploy to production with source code
    steps:
      - name: Checkout GitHub Action
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Login via Azure CLI
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: deploy to production step with source code
        uses: azure/spring-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: deploy
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
          use-staging-deployment: false
          package: ${{ env.ASC_PACKAGE_PATH }}
```

The following example deploys to the default production deployment in Azure Spring Apps using source code in the Enterprise plan. You can specify which builder to use for deploy actions using the `builder` option.

```yml
name: AzureSpringApps
on: push
env:
  ASC_PACKAGE_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION: <azure subscription name>

jobs:
  deploy_to_production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: deploy to production with source code
    steps:
      - name: Checkout GitHub Action
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Login via Azure CLI
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: deploy to production step with source code in the Enterprise plan
        uses: azure/spring-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: deploy
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
          use-staging-deployment: false
          package: ${{ env.ASC_PACKAGE_PATH }}
          builder: <builder>
```

The following example deploys to the default production deployment in Azure Spring Apps with an existing container image.

```yml
name: AzureSpringApps
on: push
env:
  ASC_PACKAGE_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION: <azure subscription name>

jobs:
  deploy_to_production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: deploy to production with source code
    steps:
      - name: Checkout GitHub Action
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Login via Azure CLI
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: Deploy Custom Image
        uses: Azure/spring-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: deploy
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
          deployment-name: <deployment name>
          container-registry: <your container image registry>
          registry-username: ${{ env.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
          registry-password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
          container-image: <your image tag>
```

During deployment, you can achieve more functionality by using more arguments. For more information, see the [Arguments](https://github.com/Azure/spring-apps-deploy#arguments) section of [GitHub Action for deploying to Azure Spring Apps](https://github.com/Azure/spring-apps-deploy).

#### Blue-green

The following examples deploy to an existing staging deployment. This deployment doesn't receive production traffic until it's set as a production deployment. You can set use-staging-deployment true to find the staging deployment automatically or just allocate specific deployment-name. We only focus on the `spring-apps-deploy` action and leave out the preparatory jobs in the rest of the article.

```yml
# environment preparation configurations omitted
    steps:
      - name: blue green deploy step use-staging-deployment
        uses: azure/spring-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: deploy
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
          use-staging-deployment: true
          package: ${{ env.ASC_PACKAGE_PATH }}/**/*.jar
```

```yml
# environment preparation configurations omitted
    steps:
      - name: blue green deploy step with deployment-name
        uses: azure/spring-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: deploy
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
          deployment-name: staging
          package: ${{ env.ASC_PACKAGE_PATH }}/**/*.jar
```

For more information on blue-green deployments, including an alternative approach, see [Blue-green deployment strategies](./concepts-blue-green-deployment-strategies.md).

### Setting production deployment

The following example sets the current staging deployment as production, effectively swapping which deployment receives production traffic.

```yml
# environment preparation configurations omitted
    steps:
      - name: set production deployment step
        uses: azure/spring-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: set-production
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
          use-staging-deployment: true
```

### Deleting a staging deployment

The `Delete Staging Deployment` action allows you to delete the deployment not receiving production traffic. This deletion frees up resources used by that deployment and makes room for a new staging deployment:

```yml
# environment preparation configurations omitted
    steps:
      - name: Delete staging deployment step
        uses: azure/spring-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: delete-staging-deployment
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
```

### Create or update build (Enterprise plan only)

The following example creates or updates a build resource in the Enterprise plan:

```yml
# environment preparation configurations omitted
    steps:
      - name: Create or update build
        uses: azure/spring-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: build
          service-name: <service instance name>
          build-name: <build name>
          package: ${{ env.ASC_PACKAGE_PATH }}
          builder: <builder>
```

### Delete build (Enterprise plan only)

The following example deletes a build resource in the Enterprise plan:

```yml
# environment preparation configurations omitted
    steps:
      - name: Delete build
        uses: azure/spring-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: delete-build
          service-name: <service instance name>
          build-name: <build name>
```

## Deploy with Maven Plugin

Another option is to use the [Maven Plugin](./how-to-maven-deploy-apps.md) for deploying the Jar and updating App settings. The command `mvn azure-spring-apps:deploy` is idempotent and automatically creates Apps if needed. You don't need to create corresponding apps in advance.

```yaml
name: AzureSpringApps
on: push

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - uses: actions/checkout@main

    - name: Set up Java 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '11'

    - name: maven build, clean
      run: |
        mvn clean package -DskipTests

    # Maven plugin can cosume this authentication method automatically
    - name: Azure Login
      uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

    # Maven deploy, make sure you have correct configurations in your pom.xml
    - name: deploy to Azure Spring Apps using Maven
      run: |
        mvn azure-spring-apps:deploy
```

::: zone-end

## Run the workflow

GitHub **Actions** should be enabled automatically after you push **.github/workflow/main.yml** to GitHub. The action is triggered when you push a new commit. If you create this file in the browser, your action should have already run.

To verify that the action has been enabled, select the **Actions** tab on the GitHub repository page:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-github-actions/actions3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub Actions tab showing the All workflows section." lightbox="media/how-to-github-actions/actions3.png":::

If your action runs in error, for example, if you haven't set the Azure credential, you can rerun checks after fixing the error. On the GitHub repository page, select **Actions**, select the specific workflow task, and then select the **Rerun checks** button to rerun checks:
