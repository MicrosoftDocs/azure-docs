# Use Application Insights Java In-Process Agent in Azure Spring Apps

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]
>
> With Spring Boot Native Image applications, use the [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro / Application Insights in Spring Boot native image Java application](https://aka.ms/AzMonSpringNative) project instead of the Application Insights Java agent.


**This article applies to:** ✅ Standard consumption and dedicated (Preview) ✅ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

This article explains how to monitor applications by using the Application Insights Java agent in Azure Spring Apps.

With this feature you can:

* Search tracing data with different filters.
* View a dependency map of Spring applications.
* Check request performance.
* Monitor real-time live metrics.
* Check request failures.
* Check application metrics.
* Check application logs.

Application Insights can provide many observable perspectives, including:

* Application map
* Performance
* Failures
* Metrics
* Live Metrics
* Availability
* Logs

## Using the Application Insights feature

When the **Application Insights** feature is enabled, you can:

* In the navigation pane, select **Application Insights** to view the **Overview** page of Application Insights. The **Overview** page shows you an overview of all running applications.
* Select **Application Map** to see the status of calls between applications.

## Manage Application Insights using Azure CLI

You can manage Application Insights using Azure CLI commands. In the following commands, be sure to replace the `<placeholder>` text with the values described. The `<service-instance-name>` placeholder refers to the name of your Azure Spring Apps instance.

### Enable Application Insights

To configure Application Insights when creating an Azure Spring Apps instance, use the following command. For the `app-insights` argument, you can specify an Application Insights name or resource ID.

::: zone pivot="sc-standard"

```azurecli
az spring create \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name "service-instance-name" \
    --app-insights <name-or-resource-ID> \
    --sampling-rate <sampling-rate>
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

```azurecli
az spring create \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name "service-instance-name" \
    --app-insights <name-or-resource-ID> \
    --sampling-rate <sampling-rate> \
    --sku Enterprise
```

::: zone-end

You can also use an Application Insights connection string (preferred) or instrumentation key, as shown in the following example.

::: zone pivot="sc-standard"

```azurecli
az spring create \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --app-insights-key <connection-string-or-instrumentation-key> \
    --sampling-rate <sampling-rate>
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

```azurecli
az spring create \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --app-insights-key <connection-string-or-instrumentation-key> \
    --sampling-rate <sampling-rate> \
    --sku Enterprise
```

::: zone-end

### Disable Application Insights

To disable Application Insights when creating an Azure Spring Apps instance, use the following command:

::: zone pivot="sc-standard"

```azurecli
az spring create \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --disable-app-insights
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

```azurecli
az spring create \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --disable-app-insights \
    --sku Enterprise
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-standard"

### Check Application Insights settings

To check the Application Insights settings of an existing Azure Spring Apps instance, use the following command:

```azurecli
az spring app-insights show \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <service-instance-name>
```

### Update Application Insights

To update Application Insights to use a connection string (preferred) or instrumentation key, use the following command:

```azurecli
az spring app-insights update \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --app-insights-key <connection-string-or-instrumentation-key> \
    --sampling-rate <sampling-rate>
```

To update Application Insights to use the resource name or ID, use the following command:

```azurecli
az spring app-insights update \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --app-insights <name-or-resource-ID> \
    --sampling-rate <sampling-rate>
```

### Disable Application Insights with the update command

To disable Application Insights on an existing Azure Spring Apps instance, use the following command:

```azurecli
az spring app-insights update \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --disable
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

### Manage Application Insights buildpack bindings

This section applies to the Enterprise plan only, and provides instructions that supplement the previous section.

The Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan uses buildpack bindings to integrate [Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) with the type `ApplicationInsights`. For more information, see [How to configure APM integration and CA certificates](../enterprise/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-integration-and-ca-certificates.md).

To create an Application Insights buildpack binding, use the following command:

```azurecli
az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding create \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> \
    --service <your-service-instance-name> \
    --name <your-binding-name> \
    --builder-name <your-builder-name> \
    --type ApplicationInsights \
    --properties sampling-percentage=<your-sampling-percentage> \
                 connection-string=<your-connection-string>
```

To list all buildpack bindings, and find Application Insights bindings the type `ApplicationInsights`, use the following command:

```azurecli
az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding list \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> \
    --service <your-service-resource-name> \
    --builder-name <your-builder-name>
```

To replace an Application Insights buildpack binding, use the following command:

```azurecli
az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding set \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> \
    --service <your-service-instance-name> \
    --name <your-binding-name> \
    --builder-name <your-builder-name> \
    --type ApplicationInsights \
    --properties sampling-percentage=<your-sampling-percentage> \
                 connection-string=<your-connection-string>
```

To get an Application Insights buildpack binding, use the following command:

```azurecli
az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding show \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> \
    --service <your-service-instance-name> \
    --name <your-binding-name> \
    --builder-name <your-builder-name>
```

To delete an Application Insights buildpack binding, use the following command:

```azurecli
az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding delete \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> \
    --service <your-service-instance-name> \
    --name <your-binding-name> \
    --builder-name <your-builder-name>
```

## Automation

::: zone pivot="sc-standard"

The following sections describe how to automate your deployment using Bicep, Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) or Terraform.

### Bicep

To deploy using a Bicep file, copy the following content into a **main.bicep** file. For more information, see [Microsoft.AppPlatform Spring/monitoringSettings](/azure/templates/microsoft.appplatform/spring/monitoringsettings).

```bicep
param springName string
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource spring 'Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring@2020-07-01' = {
  name: springName
  location: location
  properties: {}
}

resource monitorSetting 'Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/monitoringSettings@2020-11-01-preview' = {
  parent: spring
  name: 'default'
  properties: {
    appInsightsInstrumentationKey: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
    appInsightsSamplingRate: 88
  }
}
```

### ARM templates

To deploy using an ARM template, copy the following content into an **azuredeploy.json** file. For more information, see [Microsoft.AppPlatform Spring/monitoringSettings](/azure/templates/microsoft.appplatform/spring/monitoringsettings).

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "springName": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "location": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]"
    }
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring",
      "apiVersion": "2020-07-01",
      "name": "[parameters('springName')]",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "properties": {}
    },
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/monitoringSettings",
      "apiVersion": "2020-11-01-preview",
      "name": "[format('{0}/{1}', parameters('springName'), 'default')]",
      "properties": {
        "appInsightsInstrumentationKey": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
        "appInsightsSamplingRate": 88
      },
      "dependsOn": [
        "[resourceId('Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring', parameters('springName'))]"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Terraform

For a Terraform deployment, use the following template. For more information, see [azurerm_spring_cloud_service](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/spring_cloud_service).

```terraform
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_application_insights" "example" {
  name                = "tf-test-appinsights"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  application_type    = "web"
}

resource "azurerm_spring_cloud_service" "example" {
  name                = "example-springcloud"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  sku_name            = "S0"

  config_server_git_setting {
    uri          = "https://github.com/Azure-Samples/piggymetrics"
    label        = "config"
    search_paths = ["dir1", "dir2"]
  }

  trace {
    connection_string = azurerm_application_insights.example.connection_string
    sample_rate       = 10.0
  }

  tags = {
    Env = "staging"
  }
}
```

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

Automation in the Enterprise plan is pending support. Documentation is added as soon as it's available.

::: zone-end

## Java agent update/upgrade

::: zone pivot="sc-standard"

The Java agent is updated/upgraded regularly with the JDK, which may affect the following scenarios.

> [!NOTE]
> The JDK version is updated/upgraded quarterly per year.

* Existing applications that use the Java agent before updating/upgrading aren't affected.
* Applications created after updating/upgrading use the new version of the Java agent.
* Existing applications that didn't previously use the Java agent require restart or redeployment to use the new version of the Java agent.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

The Java agent is updated/upgraded when the buildpack is updated.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-standard"

## Java agent configuration hot-loading

Azure Spring Apps has a hot-loading mechanism to adjust the settings of agent configuration without restart of applications.


> [!NOTE]
> The hot-loading mechanism has a delay in minutes.

* If the Java agent is already enabled, changes to the Application Insights instance or `SamplingRate` value don't require application restart.

* If you enable the Java agent, then you must restart applications.
* When you disable the Java agent, applications stop sending all monitoring data after a delay in minutes. You can restart applications to remove the agent from the Java runtime environment.

::: zone-end

## Concept matching between Azure Spring Apps and Application Insights

| Azure Spring Apps | Application Insights                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `App`              | * __Application Map__/Role<br />* __Live Metrics__/Role<br />* __Failures__/Roles/Cloud Role<br />* __Performance__/Roles/Could Role |
| `App Instance`     | * __Application Map__/Role Instance<br />* __Live Metrics__/Service Name<br />* __Failures__/Roles/Cloud Instance<br />* __Performance__/Roles/Could Instance |

The name `App Instance` from Azure Spring Apps is changed or generated in the following scenarios:

* You create a new application.
* You deploy a JAR file or source code to an existing application.
* You initiate a blue/green deployment.
* You restart the application.
* You stop the deployment of an application, and then restart it.

When data is stored in Application Insights, it contains the history of Azure Spring Apps app instances created or deployed since the Java agent was enabled. For example, in the Application Insights portal, you can see application data created yesterday, but then deleted within a specific time range, like the last 24 hours. The following scenarios show how this works:

* You created an application around 8:00 AM today from Azure Spring Apps with the Java agent enabled, and then you deployed a JAR file to this application around 8:10 AM today. After some testing, you change the code and deploy a new JAR file to this application at 8:30 AM today. Then, you take a break, and when you come back around 11:00 AM, you check some data from Application Insights. You see:
  * Three instances in Application Map with time ranges in the last 24 hours, and Failures, Performance, and Metrics.
  * One instance in Application Map with a time range in the last hour, and Failures, Performance, and Metrics.
  * One instance in Live Metrics.
* You created an application around 8:00 AM today from Azure Spring Apps with the Java agent enabled, and then you deployed a JAR file to this application around 8:10 AM today. Around 8:30 AM today, you try a blue/green deployment with another JAR file. Currently, you have two deployments for this application. After a break around 11:00 AM today, you want to check some data from Application Insights. You see:
  * Three instances in Application Map with time ranges in the last 24 hours, and Failures, Performance, and Metrics.
  * Two instances in Application Map with time ranges in last hour, and Failures, Performance, and Metrics.
  * Two instances in Live Metrics.
