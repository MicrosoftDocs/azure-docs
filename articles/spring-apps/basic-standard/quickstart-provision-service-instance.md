# Provision an Azure Spring Apps service instance

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ❎ Standard consumption and dedicated (Preview) ✅ Basic/Standard ❎ Enterprise

This article shows you how to provision a Basic or Standard plan Azure Spring Apps service instance.

Azure Spring Apps supports multiple plans. For more information, see [Quotas and service plans for Azure Spring Apps](quotas.md). To learn how to create service instances for the Enterprise plan, see [Migrate an Azure Spring Apps Basic or Standard plan instance to the Enterprise plan](how-to-migrate-standard-tier-to-enterprise-tier.md).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- (Optional) [Azure CLI version 2.45.0 or higher](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Provision an instance of Azure Spring Apps

Use the following steps to create an instance of Azure Spring Apps:

#### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

1. In a new browser tab, open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Using the search box, search for *Azure Spring Apps*.

1. Select **Azure Spring Apps** from the search results.

1. On the Azure Spring Apps page, select **Create**.

1. Fill out the form on the Azure Spring Apps **Create** page. Consider the following guidelines:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you want to be billed for this resource.
   - **Resource group**: Creating new resource groups for new resources is a best practice. You use this value in later steps as `<resource-group-name>`.
   - **Service Details/Name**: Specify the `<service-instance-name>`. The name must be between 4 and 32 characters long and can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. The first character of the service name must be a letter and the last character must be either a letter or a number.
   - **Location**: Select the location for your service instance.
   - **Zone Redundant**: Select to create your service instance with an availability zone.
   - Select **Standard** for the **Pricing tier** option.

1. Select **Review and create**.

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/Azure-CLI)

1. Use the following command to add or update the Azure Spring Apps extension for the Azure CLI:

   ```azurecli
   az extension add --upgrade --name spring
   ```

1. Use the following commands to sign in to the Azure CLI and choose your active subscription. If you have access to only one subscription, you can skip the `az account set` command.

   ```azurecli
   az login
   az account list --output table
   az account set --subscription <subscription-name-or-ID>
   ```

1. Prepare a name for your Azure Spring Apps service. The name must be between 4 and 32 characters long and can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. The first character of the service name must be a letter and the last character must be either a letter or a number.

1. use the following commands to create a resource group to contain your Azure Spring Apps service instance, and to create the service instance:

   ```azurecli
   az group create \
       --name <resource-group-name> \
       --location <resource-group-region>
   az spring create \
       --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
       --name <service-instance-name>
   ```

## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue working with subsequent tutorials, you might want to leave these resources in place. When no longer needed, delete the resource group, which deletes the resources in the resource group. To delete the resource group by using Azure CLI, use the following commands:

```azurecli
az group delete --name <resource-group-name>
```
