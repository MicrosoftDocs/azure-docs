# Quickstart: Deploy an event-driven application to Azure Spring Apps

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ✅ Standard consumption and dedicated (Preview) ✅ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

This article explains how to deploy a Spring Boot event-driven application to Azure Spring Apps.

The sample project is an event-driven application that subscribes to a [Service Bus queue](../../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions.md#queues) named `lower-case`, and then handles the message and sends another message to another queue named `upper-case`. To make the app simple, message processing just converts the message to uppercase. The following diagram depicts this process:

This article provides the following options for deploying to Azure Spring Apps:

- The **Azure portal** option is the easiest and fastest way to create resources and deploy applications with a single click. This option is suitable for Spring developers who want to quickly deploy applications to Azure cloud services.
- The **Azure portal + Maven plugin** option is a more conventional way to create resources and deploy applications step by step. This option is suitable for Spring developers using Azure cloud services for the first time.
- The **Azure CLI** option uses a powerful command line tool to manage Azure resources. This option is suitable for Spring developers who are familiar with Azure cloud services.

## 5. Validate the app

Use the following steps to confirm that the event-driven app works correctly. You can validate the app by sending a message to the `lower-case` queue, then confirm that there's a message in the `upper-case` queue.

::: zone pivot="sc-consumption-plan,sc-standard"

[!INCLUDE [validate-event-driven-app](includes/quickstart-deploy-event-driven-app/validate-event-driven-app.md)]

3. Go to the Azure Spring Apps instance **Overview** page and select **Logs** to check the app's logs.
