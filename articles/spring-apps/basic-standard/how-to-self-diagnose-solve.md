# Self-diagnose and solve problems in Azure Spring Apps

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ✅ Java ✅ C#

**This article applies to:** ✅ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

This article shows you how to use Azure Spring Apps diagnostics.

Azure Spring Apps diagnostics is an interactive experience to troubleshoot your app without configuration. Azure Spring Apps diagnostics identifies problems and guides you to information that helps troubleshoot and resolve issues.

## Prerequisites

To complete this exercise, you need:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* A deployed Azure Spring Apps service instance. For more information, see [Quickstart: Deploy your first application to Azure Spring Apps](./quickstart.md).
* At least one application already created in your service instance.

## Navigate to the diagnostics page

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Go to your Azure Spring Apps **Overview** page.
3. Select **Diagnose and solve problems** in the navigation pane.

## Search logged issues

To find an issue, you can either search by typing a keyword or select the solution group to explore all in that category.

Selection of **Config Server Health Check**, **Config Server Health Status**, or **Config Server Update History** displays various results.

Find your target detector and select it to execute. A summary of diagnostics is shown after you execute the detector. Select **View details** to check diagnostic details.

You can change the diagnostic time range with the controller for **CPU Usage**. There can be a 15-minute delay for metrics and logs.
