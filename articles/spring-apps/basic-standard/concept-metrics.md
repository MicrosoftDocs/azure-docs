# Metrics for Azure Spring Apps

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ✅ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

Azure Metrics explorer is a component of the Microsoft Azure portal that allows plotting charts, visually correlating trends, and investigating spikes and dips in metrics. Use the metrics explorer to investigate the health and utilization of your resources.

In an Azure Spring Apps instance, you can view metrics on the following pages:

* The application overview page, which shows quick status charts. To view this page, select **Apps** from the navigation pane, and then select an app.

* The common metrics page, which shows common metrics available to all apps in the Azure Spring Apps instance. For the Enterprise plan, it also shows common metrics for Tanzu Spring Cloud Gateway. To view this page, select **Metrics** from the navigation pane. You can build your own charts in the common metrics page and pin them to your Dashboard.

## Application overview page

Select **Apps** in the navigation pane and then select an app from the list. The app overview page presents metrics charts that enable you to perform a quick status check of your application.

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-metrics/app-overview-metrics-charts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the overview page for an application with the time period selector highlighted." lightbox="media/concept-metrics/app-overview-metrics-charts.png":::

Azure Spring Apps provides these five charts with metrics that are updated every minute:

* **Http Server Errors**: Error count for HTTP requests to your app
* **Data In**: Bytes received by your app
* **Data Out**: Bytes sent by your app
* **Requests**: Requests received by your app
* **Average Response Time**: Average response time from your app

For the chart, you can select a time range from one hour to seven days.

## Common metrics page

Select **Metrics** in the navigation pane to access common metrics. Select a metric to use from the **Metric** dropdown.

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-metrics/metric-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Azure Spring Apps Metrics page with the Metric dropdown menu open." lightbox="media/concept-metrics/metric-dropdown.png":::

For metric details, see the [User metric options](#user-metrics-options) section.

Next, select the aggregation type for each metric:

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-metrics/aggregation-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Azure Spring Apps Metrics page with the Aggregation dropdown menu open." lightbox="media/concept-metrics/aggregation-dropdown.png":::

The aggregation type indicates how to aggregate metric points in the chart by time. There's one raw metric point every minute, and the pre-aggregation type within a minute is pre-defined by metrics type.

* Sum: Sum all values as target output.
* Average: Use the Average value in the period as target output.
* Max/Min: Use the Max/Min value in the period as target output.

The time range can also be adjusted from last 30 minutes to last 30 days or a custom time range.

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-metrics/time-range.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Azure Spring Apps Metrics page with the chart time range options highlighted." lightbox="media/concept-metrics/time-range.png":::

The default view includes all of an Azure Spring Apps service's application's metrics together. Metrics of one app or instance can be filtered in the display. Select **Add filter**, set the property to **App**, and select the target application you want to monitor in the **Values** text box.

You can use two kinds of filters (properties):

* App: filter by app name
* Instance: filter by app instance
* Deployment: filter by deployment name

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-metrics/add-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Azure Spring Apps Metrics page with a chart selected and the Add filter controls highlighted." lightbox="media/concept-metrics/add-filter.png":::

You can also use the **Apply splitting** option, which draws multiple lines for one app:

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-metrics/apply-splitting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Azure Spring Apps Metrics page with a chart selected and the Apply splitting option highlighted." lightbox="media/concept-metrics/apply-splitting.png"::::

>[!TIP]
> You can build your own charts on the metrics page and pin them to your **Dashboard**. Start by naming your chart.  Next, select **Pin to dashboard in the top right corner**. You can now check on your application at your Portal **Dashboard**.

## User metrics options

> [!NOTE]
> For Spring Boot applications, to see metrics from Spring Boot Actuator, add the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency. For more information, see the [Add actuator dependency](concept-manage-monitor-app-spring-boot-actuator.md#add-actuator-dependency) section of [Manage and monitor app with Spring Boot Actuator](concept-manage-monitor-app-spring-boot-actuator.md).

The following tables show the available metrics and details.

### Error

>[!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
>| Name | Spring Boot Actuator metric name | Unit | Description |
>|----|----|----|------------|
>| `tomcat.global.error` | `tomcat.global.error` | Count | Number of errors that occurred in processed requests. |

### Performance

>[!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
>| Name | Spring Boot Actuator metric name | Unit | Description |
>|----|----|----|------------|
>| `system.cpu.usage` | `system.cpu.usage` | Percent | **[Obsolete]** Recent CPU usage for the whole system. This metric is deprecated because the accuracy isn't reliable. Use `App CPU Usage` instead. The value is a double in the [0.0,1.0] interval. A value of 0.0 means that all CPUs were idle during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. |
>| `process.cpu.usage` | App CPU Usage Percentage | Percent | **[Obsolete]** Recent CPU usage for the Java Virtual Machine process. The metric is deprecated because the accuracy isn't reliable. Use `App CPU Usage` instead. The value is a double in the [0.0,1.0] interval. A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads from the JVM process during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running threads from the JVM 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. Threads from the JVM include the application threads as well as the JVM internal threads. |
>| App CPU Usage | | Percent | The ratio of CPU time used in cores to the total CPU limit. It represents the proportion of CPU resources consumed by a k8s container, mainly for the JVM process. This value is a double in the [0.0,1.0] interval. A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads from the JVM process during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running threads from the JVM 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. Threads from the JVM include the application threads as well as the JVM internal threads.|
>| App CPU Usage (Deprecated) | | Percent | Deprecated metric of App CPU Usage. Use the new App CPU Usage metric instead.|
>| App Memory Usage | | Percent | Recent memory usage of the JVM process against the memory allocated to this app. This value is a double in the [0.0,1.0] interval. A value of 0.0 means that none of the memory was allocated by threads from the JVM process during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all memory was allocated by threads from the JVM 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. Threads from the JVM include the application threads as well as the JVM internal threads.|
>| `jvm.memory.committed` | `jvm.memory.committed` | Bytes | Represents the amount of memory that is guaranteed to be available for use by the JVM. The JVM may release memory to the system and committed could be less than init. committed will always be greater than or equal to used. |
>| `jvm.memory.used` | `jvm.memory.used` | Bytes | Represents the amount of memory currently used in bytes. |
>| `jvm.memory.max` | `jvm.memory.max` | Bytes | Represents the maximum amount of memory that can be used for memory management. The amount of used and committed memory will always be less than or equal to max if max is defined. A memory allocation may fail if it attempts to increase the used memory such that used > committed even if used <= max would still be true (for example, when the system is low on virtual memory). |
>| `jvm.gc.max.data.size` | `jvm.gc.max.data.size` | Bytes | The peak memory usage of the old generation memory pool since the Java virtual machine was started. |
>| `jvm.gc.live.data.size` | `jvm.gc.live.data.size` | Bytes | Size of old generation memory pool after a full garbage collection (GC). |
>| `jvm.gc.memory.promoted` | `jvm.gc.memory.promoted` | Bytes | Count of positive increases in the size of the old generation memory pool before GC to after GC. |
>| `jvm.gc.memory.allocated` | `jvm.gc.memory.allocated` | Bytes | Incremented for an increase in the size of the young generation memory pool after one GC to before the next. |
>| `jvm.gc.pause.total.count` | `jvm.gc.pause` (total-count) | Count | Total GC count after this JMV started, including Young and Old GC. |
>| `jvm.gc.pause.total.time` | `jvm.gc.pause` (total-time) | Milliseconds | Total GC time consumed after this JMV started, including Young and Old GC. |
