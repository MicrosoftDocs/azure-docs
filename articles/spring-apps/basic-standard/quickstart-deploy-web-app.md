# Quickstart: Deploy your first web application to Azure Spring Apps

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

This quickstart shows how to deploy a Spring Boot web application to Azure Spring Apps. The sample project is a simple ToDo application to add tasks, mark when they're complete, and then delete them. The following screenshot shows the application:

:::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-deploy-web-app/todo-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sample web application in Azure Spring Apps." lightbox="./media/quickstart-deploy-web-app/todo-app.png":::

This application is a typical three-layers web application with the following layers:

- A frontend bounded [React](https://reactjs.org/) application.
- A backend Spring web application that uses Spring Data JPA to access a relational database.
- A relational database. For localhost, the application uses [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html). For Azure Spring Apps, the application uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL. For more information about Azure Database for PostgreSQL, see [Flexible Server documentation](/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/overview).

The following diagram shows the architecture of the system:

This article provides the following options for deploying to Azure Spring Apps:

- The **Azure portal** option is the easiest and the fastest way to create resources and deploy applications with a single click. This option is suitable for Spring developers who want to quickly deploy applications to Azure cloud services.
- The **Azure portal + Maven plugin** option provides a more conventional way to create resources and deploy applications step by step. This option is suitable for Spring developers using Azure cloud services for the first time.
- The **Azure Developer CLI** option is a more efficient way to automatically create resources and deploy applications through simple commands. The Azure Developer CLI uses a template to provision the Azure resources needed and to deploy the application code. This option is suitable for Spring developers who are familiar with Azure cloud services.

### [Azure portal + Maven plugin](#tab/Azure-portal-maven-plugin-ent)

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/), version 17.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/Azure-CLI)

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## 5. Validate the web app

Now you can access the deployed app to see whether it works.

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal-ent)

Use the following steps to validate:

1. After the deployment finishes, you can find the application URL from the deployment outputs:

   :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-deploy-web-app/web-app-url-standard.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the enterprise app URL of the ARM deployment outputs." border="false" lightbox="media/quickstart-deploy-web-app/web-app-url-standard.png":::

1. Access the application with the output application URL. The page should appear as you saw in localhost.

1. Check the details for each resource deployment, which are useful for investigating any deployment issues.

### [Azure portal + Maven plugin](#tab/Azure-portal-maven-plugin-ent)

Access the application with the output application URL. The page should appear as you saw in localhost.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/Azure-CLI)

Use the following steps to validate:

1. After the deployment finishes, you can access the app with this URL: `https://${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME}-${APP_NAME}.azuremicroservices.io/`. The page should appear as you saw in localhost.

1. To check the app's log to investigate any deployment issue, use the following command:

   ```azurecli
   az spring app logs \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME} \
       --name ${APP_NAME}
   ```

## 6. Clean up resources

Be sure to delete the resources you created in this article when you no longer need them. You can delete the Azure resource group, which includes all the resources in the resource group.
