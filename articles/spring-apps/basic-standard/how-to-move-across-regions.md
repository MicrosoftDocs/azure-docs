# Move an Azure Spring Apps service instance to another region

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ✅ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

This article shows you how to move your Azure Spring Apps service instance to another region. Moving your instance is useful, for example, as part of a disaster recovery plan or to create a duplicate testing environment.

You can't move an Azure Spring Apps instance from one region to another directly, but you can use an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to deploy your instance to a new region. For more information about using Azure Resource Manager and templates, see [Quickstart: Create and deploy ARM templates by using the Azure portal](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal.md).

Before you move your service instance, consider the following limitations:

- Different feature sets are supported by different pricing plans (SKUs). If you change the SKU, you may need to change the template to include only features supported by the target SKU.
- You might not be able to move all subresources in Azure Spring Apps using the template. Your move may require extra setup after the template is deployed. For more information, see the [Configure the new Azure Spring Apps service instance](#configure-the-new-azure-spring-apps-service-instance) section of this article.
- When you move a virtual network (VNet) instance, you must create new network resources. For more information, see [Deploy Azure Spring Apps in a virtual network](how-to-deploy-in-azure-virtual-network.md).

## Prerequisites

- An existing Azure Spring Apps service instance. To create a new service instance, see [Quickstart: Deploy your first application in Azure Spring Apps](./quickstart.md).
- (Optional) [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.11.2 or later.

## Export the template

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Use the following steps to export the template:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **All resources** in the left menu, and then select your Azure Spring Apps instance.
1. Under **Automation**, select **Export template**.
1. Select **Download** on the **Export template** pane.
1. Locate the **.zip** file, unzip it, and get the **template.json** file. This file contains the resource template.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the following command to export the template:

```azurecli
az login
az account set --subscription <resource-subscription-id>
az group export \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --resource-ids <resource-id>
```

---

## Modify the template

Use the following steps to modify the **template.json** file. In the following examples, the new Azure Spring Apps instance name is `new-service-name`. The previous instance name is `old-service-name`.

1. The following example shows how to change all `name` instances in the template from `old-service-name` to `new-service-name`:

   ```json
   {
       "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring",
       "apiVersion": "{api-version}",
       "_comment": "the following line was changed from 'old-service-name'",
       "name": "[parameters('new-service-name')]",
       ….
   }
   ```

1. The following example shows how to change the `location` instances in the template to the new target location:

   ```json
       {
           "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring",
           "apiVersion": "{api-version}",
           "name": "[parameters('new_service_name')]",
           "_comment": "the following line was changed from 'old-region'",
           "location": "{new-region}",
           …..
       }
   ```

1. If the instance you're moving is a virtual network instance, the following example shows how to update the target virtual network resource `parameters` instances in the template:

   ```json
   "parameters": {
       …
       "virtualNetworks_service_vnet_externalid": {
           "_comment": "the following line was changed from 'old-vnet-resource-id'",
           "defaultValue": "{new-vnet-resource-id}",
           "type": "String"
       }
   },
   ```

   The following example shows how to make sure the `serviceRuntimeSubnetId` and `appSubnetId` subnets exist. The subnets are defined in the `networkProfile` service:

   ```json
   {
       "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring",
       "apiVersion": "{api-version}",
       "name": "[parameters('Spring_new_service_name')]",
       …
       "properties": {
           "networkProfile": {
               "serviceRuntimeSubnetId": "[concat(parameters('virtualNetworks_service_vnet_externalid'), '/subnets/apps-subnet')]",
               "appSubnetId": "[concat(parameters('virtualNetworks_service_vnet_externalid'), '/subnets/service-runtime-subnet')]",
           }
       }
   }
   ```

1. If any custom domain resources are configured, create the CNAME records as described in [Tutorial: Map an existing custom domain to Azure Spring Apps](how-to-custom-domain.md). Make sure the record name is expected for the new service name.

1. The following example shows how to change all `relativePath` instances in the template `properties` for all app resources to `<default>`:

   ```json
   {
       "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/apps/deployments",
       "apiVersion": "{api-version}",
       "name": "[concat(parameters('Spring_new_service_name'), '/api-gateway/default')]",
       …
       "properties": {
           "active": true,
           "source": {
               "type": "Jar",
               "_comment": "the following line was changed to 'default'",
               "relativePath": "<default>"
           },
           …
       }
   }
   ```

    After the app is created, it uses a default banner application. Deploy the JAR files again using the Azure CLI. For more information, see the [Configure the new Azure Spring Apps service instance](#configure-the-new-azure-spring-apps-service-instance) section of this article.

1. If service binding was used and you want to import it to the new service instance, add the `key` property for the target bound resource. In the following example, a bound MySQL database is included:

   ```json
   {
       "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/apps/bindings",
       "apiVersion": "{api-version}",
       "name": "[concat(parameters('Spring_new_service_name'), '/api-gateway/mysql')]",
       …
       "_comment": "the following line imports a mysql binding",
       "properties": {
           "resourceId": "[parameters('servers_test_mysql_name_externalid')]",
           "key": "{mysql-password}",
           "bindingParameters": {
               "databaseName": "mysql",
               "username": "{mysql-user-name}"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## Deploy the template

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

After you modify the template, use the following steps to deploy the template and create the new resource.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the top search box, search for *Deploy a custom template*.
1. Under **Services**, select **Deploy a custom template**.
1. Go to the **Select a template** tab, and then select **Build your own template in the editor**.
1. In the template editor, paste in the **template.json** file you modified earlier, and then select **Save**.
1. In the **Basics** tab, fill in the following information:

    - The target subscription.
    - The target resource group.
    - The target region.
    - Any other parameters required for the template.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-move-across-regions/deploy-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing the Custom deployment pane." lightbox="media/how-to-move-across-regions/deploy-template.png" :::

1. Select **Review + create** to create the target service instance.
1. Wait until the template has deployed successfully. If the deployment fails, select **Deployment details** to view the reason it failed, and then update the template or configurations accordingly.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

After you modify the template, use the following command to deploy the custom template and create the new resource:

```azurecli
az login
az account set --subscription <resource-subscription-id>
az deployment group create \
  --name <custom-deployment-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --template-file <path-to-template> \
  --parameters <param-name-1>=<param-value-1>
```

Wait until the template has deployed successfully. If the deployment fails, view the deployment details with the command `az deployment group list`, and then update the template or configurations accordingly.

## Configure the new Azure Spring Apps service instance

Some features aren't exported to the template, or can't be imported with a template. You must manually set up some Azure Spring Apps items on the new instance after the template deployment completes successfully. The following guidelines describe these requirements:

- The JAR files for the previous service aren't deployed directly to the new service instance. To deploy all apps, follow the instructions in [Quickstart: Build and deploy apps to Azure Spring Apps](quickstart-deploy-apps.md). If there's no active deployment configured automatically, you must configure a production deployment. For more information, see [Set up a staging environment in Azure Spring Apps](how-to-staging-environment.md).
- Config Server won't be imported automatically. To set up Config Server on your new instance, see [Configure a managed Spring Cloud Config Server in Azure Spring Apps](how-to-config-server.md).
- Managed identity is created automatically for the new service instance, but the object ID will be different from the previous instance. For managed identity to work in the new service instance, follow the instructions in [Enable system-assigned managed identity for an application in Azure Spring Apps](how-to-enable-system-assigned-managed-identity.md).
- For Monitoring -> Metrics, see [Metrics for Azure Spring Apps](concept-metrics.md). To avoid mixing the data, create a new Log Analytics instance to collect the new data. You should also create a new instance for other monitoring configurations.
- For Monitoring -> Diagnostic settings and logs, see [Analyze logs and metrics with diagnostics settings](diagnostic-services.md).
- For Monitoring -> Application Insights, see [Use Application Insights Java In-Process Agent in Azure Spring Apps](how-to-application-insights.md).
