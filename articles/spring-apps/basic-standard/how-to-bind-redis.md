# Connect Azure Cache for Redis to your application in Azure Spring Apps

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ✅ Java ✅ C#

**This article applies to:** ✅ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

Instead of manually configuring your Spring Boot applications, you can automatically connect selected Azure services to your applications by using Azure Spring Apps. This article shows how to connect your application to Azure Cache for Redis.

## Prerequisites

* A deployed Azure Spring Apps instance
* An Azure Cache for Redis service instance
* The Azure Spring Apps extension for the Azure CLI

If you don't have a deployed Azure Spring Apps instance, follow the steps in the [Quickstart: Deploy your first application to Azure Spring Apps](./quickstart.md).

## Prepare your project

### [Java](#tab/Java)

1. Add the following dependency to your project's **pom.xml** file:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

1. Remove any `spring.redis.*` properties from the **application.properties** file

1. Update the current deployment using `az spring app update` or create a new deployment using `az spring app deployment create`.

### [Polyglot](#tab/Polyglot)

All the connection strings and credentials are injected as environment variables, which you can reference in your application code.

For the default environment variable names, see [Integrate Azure Cache for Redis with Service Connector](../../service-connector/how-to-integrate-redis-cache.md#default-environment-variable-names-or-application-properties-and-sample-code).

## Connect your app to the Azure Cache for Redis

### [Service Connector](#tab/Service-Connector)

> [!NOTE]
> By default, Service Connectors are created at the application level. To override the connections, you can create other connections again in the deployments.

1. Use the Azure CLI to configure your Spring app to connect to a Redis database with an access key using the `az spring connection create` command, as shown in the following example.

   ```azurecli
   az spring connection create redis \
       --resource-group $AZURE_SPRING_APPS_RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --service $AZURE_SPRING_APPS_SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME \
       --app $APP_NAME \
       --deployment $DEPLOYMENT_NAME \
       --target-resource-group $REDIS_RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --server $REDIS_SERVER_NAME\
       --database $REDIS_DATABASE_NAME \
       --secret
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're using [Service Connector](../../service-connector/overview.md) for the first time, start by running the command `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ServiceLinker` to register the Service Connector resource provider.
   >
   > If you're using Redis Enterprise, use the `az spring connection create redis-enterprise` command instead.

   > [!TIP]
   > Run the command `az spring connection list-support-types --output table` to get a list of supported target services and authentication methods for Azure Spring Apps. If the `az spring` command isn't recognized by the system, check that you have installed the required extension by running `az extension add --name spring`.

1. Alternatively, you can use the Azure portal to configure this connection by completing the following steps. The Azure portal provides the same capabilities as the Azure CLI and provides an interactive experience.

   1. Select your Azure Spring Apps instance in the Azure portal and then select **Apps** from the navigation menu. Choose the app you want to connect and then select **Service Connector** on the navigation menu.

   1. Select **Create**.

   1. On the **Basics** tab, for service type, select Cache for Redis. Choose a subscription and a Redis cache server. Fill in the Redis database name ("0" in this example) and under client type, select Java. Select **Next: Authentication**.

   1. On the **Authentication** tab, choose **Connection string**. Service Connector automatically retrieves the access key from your Redis database account. Select **Next: Networking**.

   1. On the **Networking** tab, select **Configure firewall rules to enable access to target service**, then select **Review + Create**.

   1. On the **Review + Create** tab, wait for the validation to pass and then select **Create**. The creation can take a few minutes to complete.

   1. Once the connection between your Spring app your Redis database has been generated, you can see it in the Service Connector page and select the unfold button to view the configured connection variables.

### [Terraform](#tab/Terraform)

The following Terraform script shows how to set up an Azure Spring Apps app with Azure Cache for Redis.

```terraform
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

variable "application_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "The name of your application"
  default     = "demo-abc"
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_redis_cache" "redis" {
  name                = "redis-${var.application_name}-001"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  capacity            = 0
  family              = "C"
  sku_name            = "Standard"
  enable_non_ssl_port = false
  minimum_tls_version = "1.2"
}

resource "azurerm_spring_cloud_service" "example" {
  name                = "${var.application_name}"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
}

resource "azurerm_spring_cloud_app" "example" {
  name                = "${var.application_name}-app"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  service_name        = azurerm_spring_cloud_service.example.name
  is_public           = true
  https_only          = true
}

resource "azurerm_spring_cloud_java_deployment" "example" {
  name                = "default"
  spring_cloud_app_id = azurerm_spring_cloud_app.example.id
  quota {
    cpu    = "2"
    memory = "4Gi"
  }
  instance_count      = 2
  jvm_options         = "-XX:+PrintGC"
  runtime_version     = "Java_11"

  environment_variables = {
    "spring.redis.host"     = azurerm_redis_cache.redis.hostname
    "spring.redis.password" = azurerm_redis_cache.redis.primary_access_key
    "spring.redis.port"     = "6380"
    "spring.redis.ssl"      = "true"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_spring_cloud_active_deployment" "example" {
  spring_cloud_app_id = azurerm_spring_cloud_app.example.id
  deployment_name     = azurerm_spring_cloud_java_deployment.example.name
}
```
