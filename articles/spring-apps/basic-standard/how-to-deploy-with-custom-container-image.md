# Deploy an application with a custom container image

> [!CAUTION]
> This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is End Of Life (EOL) status. Please consider your use and plan accordingly. For more information, see the [CentOS End Of Life guidance](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/centos/centos-end-of-life).

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ✅ Standard ✅ Enterprise

This article explains how to deploy Spring Boot applications in Azure Spring Apps using a custom container image. Deploying an application with a custom container supports most features as when deploying a JAR application. Other Java and non-Java applications can also be deployed with the container image.

## Prerequisites

* A container image containing the application.
* The image is pushed to an image registry. For more information, see [Azure Container Registry](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-tutorial-prepare-acr).

> [!NOTE]
> The web application must listen on port `1025` for the Standard plan and on port `8080` for the Enterprise plan. The way to change the port depends on the framework of the application. For example, specify `SERVER_PORT=1025` for Spring Boot applications or `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:1025/` for ASP.NET Core applications. You can disable the probe for applications that don't listen on any port. For more information, see [How to configure health probes and graceful termination periods for apps hosted in Azure Spring Apps](how-to-configure-health-probes-graceful-termination.md).

## Deploy your application

To deploy an application to a custom container image, use the following steps:

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To deploy a container image, use one of the following commands:

* To deploy a container image to the public Docker Hub to an app, use the following command:

  ```azurecli
  az spring app deploy \
     --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
     --name <your-app-name> \
     --container-image <your-container-image> \
     --service <your-service-name>
  ```

* To deploy a container image from ACR to an app, or from another private registry to an app, use the following command:

  ```azurecli
  az spring app deploy \
     --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
     --name <your-app-name> \
     --container-image <your-container-image> \
     --service <your-service-name>
     --container-registry <your-container-registry> \
     --registry-password <your-password> |
     --registry-username <your-username>
   ```

To overwrite the entry point of the image, add the following two arguments to any of the above commands:

```azurecli
    --container-command "java" \
    --container-args "-jar /app.jar -Dkey=value"
```

To disable listening on a port for images that aren't web applications, add the following argument to the above commands:

```azurecli
    --disable-probe true
```

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Open your existing Azure Spring Apps service instance.
1. Select **Apps** from left the menu, then select **Create App**.
1. Name your app, and in the **Runtime platform** pulldown list, select **Custom Container**.

1. Select **Edit** under **Image**, then fill in the fields as shown in the following image:

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Commands** and **Arguments** field are optional, which are used to overwrite the `cmd` and `entrypoint` of the image.
   >
   > You need to also specify the **Language Framework**, which is the web framework of the container image used. Currently, only **Spring Boot** is supported. For other Java applications or non-Java (polyglot) applications, select **Polyglot**.

1. Select **Save**, then select **Create** to deploy your application.

The following points will help you address common situations when deploying with a custom image.

### Trust a Certificate Authority

There are two options to trust a Certificate Authority:

Option 1: Upload via Azure Spring Apps

To load the CA certs into your apps, see [Use TLS/SSL certificates in your application in Azure Spring Apps](how-to-use-tls-certificate.md). Then the certs will be mounted into the location **/etc/azure-spring-cloud/certs/public/**.

Option 2: Manual installation in the image

To trust a CA in the image, set the following variables depending on your environment:

* You must import Java applications into the trust store by adding the following lines into your **Dockerfile**:

  ```dockerfile
  ADD EnterpriseRootCA.crt /opt/
  RUN keytool -keystore /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt -trustcacerts -importcert -alias EnterpriseRootCA -file /opt/EnterpriseRootCA.crt
  ```

* For Node.js applications, set the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable:

  ```dockerfile
  ADD EnterpriseRootCA.crt /opt/
  ENV NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="/opt/EnterpriseRootCA.crt"
  ```

* For Python, or other languages relying on the system CA store, on Debian or Ubuntu images, add the following environment variables:

  ```dockerfile
  ADD EnterpriseRootCA.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
  RUN /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates
  ```

* For Python, or other languages relying on the system CA store, on CentOS or Fedora based images, add the following environment variables:

  ```dockerfile
  ADD EnterpriseRootCA.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
  RUN /usr/bin/update-ca-trust
  ```

### Avoid unexpected behavior when images change

When your application is restarted or scaled out, the latest image will always be pulled. If the image has been changed, the newly started application instances will use the new image while the old instances will continue to use the old image.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid using the `latest` tag or overwrite the image without a tag change to avoid unexpected application behavior.

### Avoid not being able to connect to the container registry in a VNet

If you deployed the instance to a VNet, make sure you allow the network traffic to your container registry in the NSG or Azure Firewall (if used). For more information, see [Customer responsibilities for running in VNet](./vnet-customer-responsibilities.md) to add the needed security rules.

### Install an APM into the image manually

The installation steps vary on different application performance monitors (APMs) and languages. The following steps are for New Relic with Java applications. You must modify the **Dockerfile** using the following steps:

1. Download and install the agent file into the image by adding the following to the **Dockerfile**:

   ```dockerfile
   ADD newrelic-agent.jar /opt/agents/newrelic/java/newrelic-agent.jar
   ```

1. Add the environment variables required by the APM:

   ```dockerfile
   ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=appName
   ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=newRelicLicenseKey
   ```

1. Modify the image entry point by adding: `java -javaagent:/opt/agents/newrelic/java/newrelic-agent.jar`

To install the agents for other languages, refer to the official documentation for the other agents:

New Relic:

* Python: [Install the Python agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/install/python/)
* Node.js: [Install the Node.js agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent/)

Dynatrace:

* Python: [Instrument Python applications with OpenTelemetry](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-traces/opentelemetry-ingest/opent-python)
* Node.js: [Instrument Node.js applications with OpenTelemetry](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-traces/opentelemetry-ingest/opent-nodejs)

AppDynamics:

* Python: [Install the Python Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/appd/21.x/21.12/en/application-monitoring/install-app-server-agents/python-agent/install-the-python-agent)
* Node.js: [Installing the Node.js Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/appd/21.x/21.12/en/application-monitoring/install-app-server-agents/node-js-agent/install-the-node-js-agent#InstalltheNode.jsAgent-install_nodejsInstallingtheNode.jsAgent)

### View the container logs

To view the console logs of your container application, the following CLI command can be used:

```azurecli
az spring app logs \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
    --name <your-app-name> \
    --service <your-service-name> \
    --instance <your-instance-name>
```

To view the container events logs from the Azure Monitor, enter the query:

```query
AppPlatformContainerEventLogs
| where App == "hw-20220317-1b"
```

### Scan your image for vulnerabilities

We recommend that you use Microsoft Defender for Cloud with ACR to prevent your images from being vulnerable. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction?tabs=defender-for-container-arch-aks)

### Switch between JAR deployment and container deployment

You can switch the deployment type from JAR deployment to container deployment directly by redeploying using the following command:

```azurecli
az spring app deploy \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
    --name <your-app-name> \
    --container-image <your-container-image> \
    --service <your-service-name>
```

Or reversely:

```azurecli
az spring app deploy \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
    --name <your-app-name> \
    --artifact-path <your-jar-file> \
    --service <your-service-name>
```

### Create another deployment with an existing JAR deployment

You can create another deployment using an existing JAR deployment using the following command:

```azurecli
az spring app deployment create \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
    --name <your-deployment-name> \
    --app <your-app-name> \
    --container-image <your-container-image> \
    --service <your-service-name>
```

### CI/CD

Automating deployments using Azure Pipelines Tasks or GitHub Actions are supported now. For more information, see [Automate application deployments to Azure Spring Apps](how-to-cicd.md) and [Use Azure Spring Apps CI/CD with GitHub Actions](./how-to-github-actions.md)
