# Compare available plans in Azure Spring Apps

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

This article provides a comparison of plans available in Azure Spring Apps. Each plan is designed to cater to different customer scenarios and purposes, as described in the following list:

- Basic plan: An entry-level plan for individual development and testing.
- Standard plan: A Spring-centric and opinionated application hosting platform with built-in and pre-configured settings for build, service registry, storage, and more.
- Enterprise plan: This plan is designed to expedite the development and deployment of mission-critical and large-scale enterprise applications with higher SLA and large application cluster support. This plan also addresses enterprise requirements around configuration management, service discovery, API gateway, API portal, ease of integration, portability, and flexibility with on-demand managed Tanzu commercial components and Tanzu Spring Runtime support, built on top of strong partnership between VMware and Microsoft.
- Standard consumption and dedicated plan: This plan is hosted in an Azure Container Apps environment and is designed to seamlessly interact with other apps running in the same environment with simplified networking and unified observability.

The following table shows the differences between each plan:

<sup>1</sup> The configurable build service enables the following features:

- Bring your own container registry: configure your own Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store built images instead of using the Azure Spring Apps managed ACR to deploy to other Azure Spring Apps Enterprise-plan environments with verified images.
- Configure resources for the whole build pool, up to 64 vCPU and 128 GB.
- Configure which OS stack to use as the base image for your apps.
