## Monitor the application

Azure Spring Apps provides several metrics by default, including metrics on availability, performance, HTTP requests, database connections, and more. These metrics are important to clarify goals, find improvements, and formulate specific improvement measures. For more information, see [Metrics for Azure Spring Apps](../../concept-metrics.md).

This section shows you how to use metrics with your application and monitor the metrics in an Azure dashboard using the key metrics charts generated by Azure Spring Apps and Application Insights.

### Add metrics to monitor resource utilization

This section explains how to use the default metrics defined by Spring Boot and custom metrics defined in the application code. These metrics are available for applications running on Azure Spring Apps.

#### Add metrics defined by Spring Boot

Spring Boot registers several metrics, such as JVM, web server, and logging-related metrics. The following steps show you how to add `JVM Memory` as an example, but to add other metrics defined by Spring Boot, you can use the same steps.

1. Go to the Azure Spring Apps instance overview page.

1. On the navigation menu, select **Application Insights** to go to the Application Insights overview page.

1. On the navigation menu, select **Metrics**, select the edit icon in the chart title, and then rename the chart title to *JVM Memory Used*.

1. Select **Add metric**. For **Metric**, open the corresponding dropdown list and select **jvm_memory_used** under the **Log-based metrics** namespace. For **Aggregation**, select **Avg**.

1. Select **Apply splitting**. For **Values**, open the corresponding dropdown list, and then select **Cloud role name**.

> [!NOTE]
> The metrics are available after the application is deployed and running.

#### Add custom metrics defined in application code

In the PetClinic source code, the REST controllers are annotated with the micrometer `@Timed` annotation. This annotation collects metrics like the number of times a method is called or the execution time of a method.

The following list shows the custom metrics details:

- `petclinic.owner` and `petclinic.pet` are defined in the `customers-service` application.
- `petclinic.visit` is defined in the `visits-service` application.

You can define a `REST API access` chart with custom metrics and update the **Aggregation** to **Count** for each metric.

### Monitor the availability of the application

The availability or liveness of an application is determined using the Spring Boot Actuator. To check the liveness for each app on Azure Spring Apps, use the following steps:

1. Go to the Azure Spring Apps instance overview page.

1. On the navigation menu, select **Application Insights** to go to the Application Insights overview page.

1. Select **Availability**, and then select **Add Standard test** to add a test.

1. On the **Create Standard test** page, provide the following information:

   - **Test name**: Enter *api-gateway* for the API gateway app.
   - **URL**: Enter *https://\<your-Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name>-api-gateway.azuremicroservices.io/actuator/health/liveness* for the corresponding URL.
   - **Success criteria**: Extend the option.
   - **Content match**: Select the checkbox.
   - **Content must contain**: Enter *UP*.

1. Select **Save** to finish the configuration.

1. Use the following table to add other tests with these test names and URLs. Make sure the test name and app name are consistent.

   | Test name           | URL                                                                                                                      | Content must contain   |
   |---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
   | `admin-server`      | `https://<your-Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name>-admin-server.azuremicroservices.io/actuator/health/liveness`             | `UP`                   |
   | `customers-service` | `https://<your-Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name>-api-gateway.azuremicroservices.io/api/customer/actuator/health/liveness` | `UP`                   |
   | `vets-service`      | `https://<your-Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name>-api-gateway.azuremicroservices.io/api/vet/actuator/health/liveness`      | `UP`                   |
   | `visits-service`    | `https://<your-Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name>-api-gateway.azuremicroservices.io/api/visit/actuator/health/liveness`    | `UP`                   |

### Monitor the dashboard

A dashboard is a cognitive awareness and communication tool designed to help you visually identify trends, patterns, and anomalies, reason about what you see, and make effective decisions. It can aggregate various metric charts, quick links, and other important information.

Use the following steps to create a custom dashboard and pin various quickstart panes and metrics charts to the dashboard. If you choose to use the built-in dashboard for Application Insights created by Azure Spring Apps, you can skip creating the dashboard and customizing the dashboard chart. For more information, see [Application Insights Overview dashboard](../../../azure-monitor/app/overview-dashboard.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also choose a wizard based on Application Insights to quickly create a default dashboard.

1. From the Azure portal menu, select **Dashboard**. Your default view might already be set to dashboard.

1. Select **Create**, and then select **Custom** to create a custom dashboard.

1. Enter a name for the dashboard, and then select **Save**.

   This action opens the **Tile Gallery** page, from which you can select the tiles, and an empty grid where you can arrange the tiles.

> [!NOTE]
> You can allow other users to view your dashboard using a shared dashboard. For more information, see [Share an Azure dashboard](../../../azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboard-share-access.md).
