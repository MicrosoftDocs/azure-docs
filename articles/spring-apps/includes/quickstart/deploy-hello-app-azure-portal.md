For clarity of structure, a separate markdown file is used to describe how to deploy web app using Azure Portal.

[!INCLUDE [deploy-hello-app-on-azure-portal](../../includes/quickstart/deploy-hello-app-azure-portal.md)]

-->

The application deployment step has been integrated with the **Deploy to Azure** button, which you completed in the previous step.
