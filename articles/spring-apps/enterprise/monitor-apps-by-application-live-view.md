# Monitor apps using Application Live View with the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Application Live View for VMware Tanzu reaches the end of support on August 31, 2025. We recommend migrating it to self-hosted [Spring Boot Admin](https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin). For more information on how to perform the migration, see [Migrate Application Live View to Spring Boot Admin](../migration/migrate-application-live-view.md?toc=/azure/spring-apps/enterprise/toc.json&bc=/azure/spring-apps/enterprise/breadcrumb/toc.json).

**This article applies to:** ❎ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

This article describes Application Live View UI features and the pages and views included in the Application Live View user interface.

[Application Live View for VMware Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.4/tap/app-live-view-about-app-live-view.html) is a lightweight insights and troubleshooting tool that helps app developers and app operators look inside running apps.

Application Live View provides visual insights into running apps by inspecting Spring Boot Actuator information. It provides a live view of the data from inside the app only. Application Live View doesn't store any of the app data for further analysis or historical views. The easy-to-use interface lets you troubleshoot, learn, and maintain an overview of certain aspects of the apps. It provides a certain level of control to users to let them change some parameters such as log levels and environment properties of running apps.

## Prerequisites

- Application Live View for VMware Tanzu. For more information, see [Use Application Live View](./how-to-use-application-live-view.md).

## Details page

The **Details** page is the default page loaded in the **Live View** section. This page gives a tabular overview containing the following properties:

- Health endpoint
- Direct actuator access
- Framework
- Version
- New patch version
- New major version
- Build version

You can navigate between information categories by selecting from the drop-down at the top right corner of the page.
