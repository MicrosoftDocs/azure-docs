   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The Consumption workload profile has a pay-as-you-go billing model, with no starting cost. You're billed for the dedicated workload profile based on the provisioned resources. For more information, see [Workload profiles in Consumption + Dedicated plan structure environments in Azure Container Apps (preview)](../../../../container-apps/workload-profiles-overview.md) and [Azure Spring Apps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/spring-apps/).

1. Select **Review and Create** to review your selections. Select **Create** to provision the Azure Spring Apps instance.

1. On the toolbar, select the **Notifications** icon (a bell) to monitor the deployment process. After the deployment is done, you can select **Pin to dashboard**, which creates a tile for this service on your Azure portal dashboard as a shortcut to the service's **Overview** page. Select **Go to resource** to open the service's **Overview** page.

1. Use the following command to enable the Eureka server. Be sure to replace the placeholders with your own values you created in the previous step.

   ```azurecli
   az spring eureka-server enable \
       --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
       --name <Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name>
   ```

### 3.3. Register the Books application

This section provides the steps to register an application to add app roles in Microsoft Entra ID, which is used for protecting the RESTful APIs in Azure Spring Apps.

1. Go to the Azure portal homepage.

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Directory + subscription** filter (:::image type="icon" source="../../media/tutorial-authenticate-client-with-gateway/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png" border="false":::) to select the tenant in which you want to register an application.

1. Search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.

1. Enter a name for your application in the **Name** field, for example **Books**. Users of your app might see this name, and you can change it later.

1. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.

1. Select **Register** to create the application.

1. On the app **Overview** page, look for the **Application (client) ID** value, and then record it for later use. You need it to configure the YAML configuration file for this project.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**, find the **Application ID URI** at the beginning of the page, and then select **Add**.

1. On the **Edit application ID URI** page, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{client ID}`) or use a meaningful name instead of the client ID, such as `api://books`, and then select **Save**.

1. Under **Manage**, select **App roles** > **Create app role**, and then enter the following information:

   - For **Display name**, enter **Write**.
   - For **Allowed member types**, select **Applications**.
   - For **Value**, enter **Books.Write**.
   - For **Description**, enter **Adding books**.

1. Repeat the previous step to add another app role: `Books.Read`.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/tutorial-authenticate-client-with-gateway/app-roles.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Books app registration page that shows the App roles." lightbox="../../media/tutorial-authenticate-client-with-gateway/app-roles.png":::

### 3.4. Register the SPA application

The Books RESTful API app acts as a resource server, which is protected by Microsoft Entra ID. Before acquiring an access token, you're required to register another application in Microsoft Entra ID and grant permissions to the client application, which is named `SPA`.

1. Go back to your tenant in **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.

1. Enter a name for your application in the **Name** field, for example `SPA`.

1. For **Supported account types**, use the default **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.

1. Select **Register** to create the application.

1. On the app **Overview** page, look for the **Application (client) ID** value, and then record it for later use. You need it to acquire access token.

1. Select **API permissions** > **Add a permission** > **APIs my organization uses**. Select the `Books` application that you registered earlier, select the permissions **Books.Read** and **Books.Write**, and then select **Add permissions**.

1. Select **Grant admin consent for \<your-tenant-name>** to grant admin consent for the permissions you added.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/tutorial-authenticate-client-with-gateway/api-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the SPA API permissions page that shows the API permissions of a web application." lightbox="../../media/tutorial-authenticate-client-with-gateway/api-permissions.png":::

1. Navigate to **Certificates & secrets** and then select **New client secret**. 

1. On the **Add a client secret** page, enter a description for the secret, select an expiration date, and then select **Add**.

1. Look for the **Value** of the secret and then record it for later use. You need it to acquire an access token.

### 3.5. Update the configuration of Books Service app

Locate **books-service/src/main/resources/application.yml** file for the `books-service` app. Update the configuration in the `spring.cloud.azure.active-directory` section to match the following example. Be sure to replace the placeholders with the values you created previously.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    azure:
      active-directory:
        credential:
          client-id: <your-application-ID-of-Books>
        app-id-uri: <your-application-ID-URI-of-Books>
```

Use the following command to rebuild the sample project:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

## 4. Deploy the apps to Azure Spring Apps

The following steps show you how to deploy the apps to Azure.

### 4.1. Deploy the microservice apps to Azure Spring Apps

Use the following steps to deploy the apps to Azure Spring Apps using the [Maven plugin for Azure Spring Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Azure-Spring-Apps):

1. Navigate to the sample project directory and then use the following command to configure the app in Azure Spring Apps:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw com.microsoft.azure:azure-spring-apps-maven-plugin:1.18.0:config
   ```

   The following list describes the command interactions:

   - **Select child modules to configure (input numbers separated by comma, eg: [1-2,4,6], ENTER to select ALL)**: Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select all.
   - **OAuth2 login**: Authorize the login to Azure based on the OAuth2 protocol.
   - **Select subscription**: Select the subscription list number of the Azure Spring Apps instance you created, which defaults to the first subscription in the list. If you use the default number, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> directly.
   - **Select Azure Spring Apps for deployment**: Select the list number of the Azure Spring Apps instance you created. If you use the default number, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> directly.
   - **Select apps to expose public access: (input numbers separated by comma, eg: [1-2,4,6], ENTER to select NONE)**: Enter **1** for `gateway-service`.
   - **Confirm to save all the above configurations (Y/n)**: Enter <kbd>y</kbd>. If you enter <kbd>n</kbd>, the configuration isn't saved in the POM files.

1. Use the following command to deploy the app:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw azure-spring-apps:deploy
   ```

   The following list describes the command interaction:

   - **OAuth2 login**: You need to authorize the login to Azure based on the OAuth2 protocol.

   After the command is executed, you can see the following log messages, which indicate that the deployment was successful.

   ```output
   [INFO] Getting public url of app(gateway-service)...
   [INFO] Application url: https://gateway-service.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx.eastasia.azurecontainerapps.io

   ...
   
   [INFO] Artifact(books-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) is uploaded and deployment(default) is successfully updated.
   
   ...
   ```

   The output **Application url** is the base endpoint to access the ToDo RESTful API application.

### 4.2. Run the SPA app locally

Update the configuration in the `SPA` application script file **spa/server.js** to match the following example. Be sure to replace the placeholders with your own values you created in the previous step.

```javascript
const SpringCloudGatewayURL = "<URL exposed by app gateway-service>"

const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "< SPA App Registration ClientId>",
        authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/< TenantId >/",
        clientSecret: "<SPA App Registration ClientSecret>",
    },
};

const tokenRequest = {
    scopes: ["<Application ID URI of Books>/.default"]
};
```

In the SPA project directory, use the following command to run locally:

```shell
node server.js
```

> [!NOTE]
> The SPA app is a static web application, which can be deployed to any web server.
