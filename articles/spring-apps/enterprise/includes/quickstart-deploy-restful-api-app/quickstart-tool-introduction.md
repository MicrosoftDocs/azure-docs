This article describes the following options for creating resources and deploying them to Azure Spring Apps:

- The **Azure portal + Maven plugin** option provides a more conventional way to create resources and deploy applications step by step. This option is suitable for Spring developers using Azure cloud services for the first time.
- The **Azure Developer CLI** option is a more efficient way to automatically create resources and deploy applications through simple commands. The Azure Developer CLI uses a template to provision the Azure resources needed and to deploy the application code. This option is suitable for Spring developers who are familiar with Azure cloud services.
