## 2. Prepare the Spring project

To deploy the RESTful API app, the first step is to prepare the Spring project to run locally.

### [Azure portal + Maven plugin](#tab/Azure-portal-maven-plugin)

Use the following steps to clone and run the app locally:

1. Use the following command to clone the sample project from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Restful-Application.git
   ```

1. If you want to run the app locally, complete the steps in the [Expose RESTful APIs](#35-expose-restful-apis) and [Update the application configuration](#36-update-the-application-configuration) sections first, and then use the following command to run the sample application with Maven:

   ```bash
   cd ASA-Samples-Restful-Application
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

Use the following steps to initialize the web application from Azure Developer CLI templates:

1. Open a terminal, create a new empty folder, and then change directory to it.

1. Run the following command to initialize the project:

   ```bash
   azd init --template Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Restful-Application
   ```

   The following list describes the command interactions:

   - **OAuth2 login**: You need to authorize the sign in to Azure based on the OAuth2 protocol.
   - **Please enter a new environment name**: Provide an environment name. This name is used as a suffix for the resource group created to hold all the Azure resources. This name should be unique within your Azure subscription.

   The console outputs messages similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Initializing a new project (azd init)

   Downloading template code to: <your-local-path>
   (âœ“) Done: Initialized git repository

   Enter a new environment name: <your-env-name>

   SUCCESS: New project initialized!
   You can view the template code in your directory: <your-local-path>
