# Quickstart: Deploy your first Spring Batch application to Azure Spring Apps

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

This quickstart shows how to deploy a Spring Batch ephemeral application to Azure Spring Apps. The sample project is derived from the Spring Batch sample [Football Job](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/blob/main/spring-batch-samples/src/main/java/org/springframework/batch/samples/football/README.md). It's a statistics loading job. In the original sample, a unit test triggers the job. In the adapted sample, the `main` method of `FootballJobApplication` initiates the job.

**This article applies to:** ❎ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

The following diagram shows the architecture of the system:

1. Go back to the **Jobs** pane after binding the job, select **Deploy Job**, and then copy the Azure CLI command for deploying the job. Then, open a Bash window and paste the command onto the command line, replacing the artifact path with the correct value for your system. Then, run the command. Wait several minutes until the build and deployment succeed. The command and output should look similar to the following example:

   ```output
   $ az spring job deploy -s job-demo -g job-demo -n football --artifact-path target/spring-batch-football-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --build-env BP_JVM_VERSION=17
   This command is in preview and under development. Reference and support levels: https://aka.ms/CLI_refstatus
   This command usually takes minutes to run. Add '--verbose' parameter if needed.
   [1/5] Requesting for upload URL.
   [2/5] Uploading package to blob.
   [3/5] Creating or Updating build 'football'.
   [4/5] Waiting for building container image to finish. This may take a few minutes.
   ```

1. After deployment, open the overview page of the `football` job by selecting the job name. Select **Run** to initiate the task execution. You can customize each execution of the job with different parameters, such as environment variables, or just select **Run** to trigger the execution. A message indicates that the job is running.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/Azure-CLI)

### 5.1. Create and execute the job

Use the following steps to create and execute the job:

1. Use the following command navigate to the sample project folder from the **football-billboard** folder where you left off previously:

   ```azurecli
   cd ..
   cd football
   ```

1. Use the following command to create a job in the Azure Spring Apps instance and bind the service registry:

   ```azurecli
   az spring job create \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_INSTANCE} \
       --name football \
       --bind-sr
   ```

1. Use the following command to deploy the `football` sample project to the job. This command uploads and compiles the source code on Azure and makes it ready to start.

   ```azurecli
   az spring job deploy \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_INSTANCE} \
       --name football \
       --source-path . \
       --build-env BP_JVM_VERSION=17
   ```

1. Use the following command to start the job and set the `EXECUTION_NAME` variable to the job execution name:

   ```azurecli
   export EXECUTION_NAME=$(az spring job start \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_INSTANCE} \
       --name football \
       --query name \
       --output tsv)
   ```

## 6. Check the job execution result and the billboard UI

You can now access the execution of the job and check its result.

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal-ent)

Use the following steps to validate:

1. On the **Executions** pane, check the job execution result. Wait a few seconds and refresh to see the status turn to **Completed**. This value means that the job execution finishes successfully.

1. Select **View logs** to query the logs of the job execution.

   :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-deploy-spring-batch-app/view-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Logs page." lightbox="media/quickstart-deploy-spring-batch-app/view-logs.png":::

1. Open the public endpoint of the app in a browser window to see the billboard UI. Leave the app open.

   :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-deploy-spring-batch-app/billboard-ui.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sample app billboard UI." lightbox="media/quickstart-deploy-spring-batch-app/billboard-ui.png":::

1. Go back to the overview page of the `football` job and select **Run** to trigger the execution again.

1. Go back to the endpoint page in the browser and select **Refresh** to see the UI changed, as shown in the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-deploy-spring-batch-app/billboard-ui-changed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sample app billboard UI after it changes." lightbox="media/quickstart-deploy-spring-batch-app/billboard-ui-changed.png":::

### [Azure CLI](#tab/Azure-CLI)

Use the following steps to validate:

1. Use the following command to query the execution result using the job name and its execution name:

   ```azurecli
   az spring job logs \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_INSTANCE} \
       --name football \
       --execution ${EXECUTION_NAME} \
       --all-instances
   ```

   The job log streaming the job execution should look similar to the following example:

   ```output
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support.SimpleJobLauncher - No TaskExecutor has been set, defaulting to synchronous executor.
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO com.microsoft.sample.FootballJobApplication - There is {} player summary before job execution
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support.SimpleJobLauncher - Job: [SimpleJob: [name=footballJob]] launched with the following parameters: [{}]
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO org.springframework.batch.core.job.SimpleStepHandler - Executing step: [playerLoad]
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO org.springframework.batch.core.step.AbstractStep - Step: [playerLoad] executed in 200ms
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO org.springframework.batch.core.job.SimpleStepHandler - Executing step: [gameLoad]
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO org.springframework.batch.core.step.AbstractStep - Step: [gameLoad] executed in 290ms
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO org.springframework.batch.core.job.SimpleStepHandler - Executing step: [summarizationStep]
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO org.springframework.batch.core.step.AbstractStep - Step: [summarizationStep] executed in 7ms
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support.SimpleJobLauncher - Job: [SimpleJob: [name=footballJob]] completed with the following parameters: [{}] and the following status: [COMPLETED] in 519ms
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO com.microsoft.sample.FootballJobApplication - There is 1 player summary after job execution
   [football-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xxxxx] [main] INFO org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.embedded.EmbeddedDatabaseFactory - Shutting down embedded database: url='jdbc:hsqldb:mem:testdb'
   ...
   ```

1. Use the following command to retrieve the endpoint of the `football-billboard` app:

   ```azurecli
   az spring app show \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_INSTANCE} \
       --name football-billboard \
       --query properties.url
   ```

1. Open the public endpoint of the app in a browser window to see the billboard UI. Leave the app open.
