# Quickstart: Deploy your first Java Native Image application to Azure Spring Apps

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ❎ Basic/Standard ✅ Enterprise

This quickstart shows how to deploy a Spring Boot application to Azure Spring Apps as a Native Image.

[Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) capability enables you to compile Java applications to standalone executables, known as Native Images. These executables can provide significant benefits, including faster startup times and lower runtime memory overhead compared to a traditional JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

The sample project is the Spring Petclinic application. The following screenshot shows the application:

## 1. Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/), version 17.
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.45.0 or higher. Use the following command to install the Azure Spring Apps extension: `az extension add --name spring`
- If you're deploying an Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan instance for the first time in the target subscription, see the [Requirements](./how-to-enterprise-marketplace-offer.md#requirements) section of [View Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier offering in Azure Marketplace](./how-to-enterprise-marketplace-offer.md).

## 5. Validate Native Image App

Now you can access the deployed Native Image app to see whether it works. Use the following steps to validate:

1. After the deployment has completed, you can run the following command to get the app URL:

   ```azurecli
   az spring app show \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME} \
       --name ${NATIVE_APP_NAME} \
       --output table
   ```

   You can access the app with the URL shown in the output as `Public Url`. The page should appear as you saw it o localhost.

1. Use the following command to check the app's log to investigate any deployment issue:

   ```azurecli
   az spring app logs \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME} \
       --name ${NATIVE_APP_NAME}
   ```

## 6. Compare performance for JAR and Native Image

The following sections describe how to compare the performance between JAR and Native Image deployment.

### Server startup time

Use the following command to check the app's log `Started PetClinicApplication in XXX seconds` to get the server startup time for a JAR app:

```azurecli
az spring app logs \
    --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME} \
    --name ${JAR_APP_NAME}
```

The server startup time is around 25 s for a JAR app.

Use the following command to check the app's log to get the server startup time for a Native Image app:

```azurecli
az spring app logs \
    --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME} \
    --name ${NATIVE_APP_NAME}
```

The server startup time is less than 0.5 s for a Native Image app.

### Memory usage

Use the following command to scale down the memory size to 512 Mi for a Native Image app:

```azurecli
az spring app scale \
    --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME} \
    --name ${NATIVE_APP_NAME} \
    --memory 512Mi
```

The command output should show that the Native Image app started successfully.

Use the following command to scale down the memory size to 512 Mi for the JAR app:

```azurecli
az spring app scale \
    --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME} \
    --name ${JAR_APP_NAME} \
    --memory 512Mi
```

The command output should show that the JAR app failed to start due to insufficient memory. The output message should be similar to the following example: `Terminating due to java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`.

The following figure shows the optimized memory usage for the Native Image deployment for a constant workload of 400 requests per second into the Petclinic application. The memory usage is about 1/5th of the memory consumed by its equivalent JAR deployment.

Native Images offer quicker startup times and reduced runtime memory overhead when compared to the conventional Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## 7. Clean up resources

If you plan to continue working with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you might want to leave these resources in place. When you no longer need the resources, delete them by deleting the resource group. Use the following command to delete the resource group:

```azurecli
az group delete --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
```
