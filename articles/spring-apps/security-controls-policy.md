# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Basic/Standard ✔️ Enterprise

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](../governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance.md)
provides Microsoft created and managed initiative definitions, known as _built-ins_, for the
**compliance domains** and **security controls** related to different compliance standards. This
page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** for Azure Spring Apps. You can
assign the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make your Azure resources
compliant with the specific standard.
