# Azure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Java ✔️ C#

This page is an index of [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) built-in policy
definitions for Azure Spring Apps. For additional Azure Policy built-ins for other services, see

The name of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use
