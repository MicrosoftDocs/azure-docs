# Customer responsibilities for Azure Spring Apps Standard consumption and dedicated plan in a virtual network

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/deprecation-note.md)]

**This article applies to:** ✅ Standard consumption and dedicated (Preview) ❎ Basic/Standard ❎ Enterprise

This article describes the customer responsibilities for running an Azure Spring Apps Standard consumption and dedicated plan service instance in a virtual network.

Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to configure virtual networks to conform to the settings required by Kubernetes.

To control all inbound and outbound traffic for the Azure Container Apps environment, you can use NSGs to lock down a network with more restrictive rules than the default NSG rules.

## NSG allow rules

The following tables describe how to configure a collection of NSG allow rules.

> [!NOTE]
> The subnet associated with a Azure Container Apps environment requires a CIDR prefix of `/23` or larger.

### Outbound with ServiceTags

#### Considerations

- If you're running HTTP servers, you might need to add ports `80` and `443`.
- Adding deny rules for some ports and protocols with lower priority than `65000` may cause service interruption and unexpected behavior.
