## About users

Users can be read-only or full privilege. As the names indicate, the read-only users can only view the share data. The full privilege users can read share data, write to these shares, and modify or delete the share data.

 - **Full privilege user** - A local user with full access.
 - **Read-only user** - A local user with read-only access. These users are associated with shares that allow read-only operations.

The user permissions are first defined when the user is created during share creation. Modification of share-level permissions is currently not supported.

## Add a user

Do the following steps in the Azure portal to add a user.

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Data Box Gateway resource and then navigate to **Overview**. Click **+ Add user** on the command bar.

You can change the password associated with a user once the user is created. Select and click from the list of users. Supply and confirm the new password. Save the changes.
