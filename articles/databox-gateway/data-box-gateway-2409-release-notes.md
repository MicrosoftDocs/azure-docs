## Known issues in this release

Because this release uses a new operating system (OS) version and includes filesystem metadata schema differences, rollback or downgrade isn't allowed. Any upgrade failure might result in downtime and the need for data recovery. The following precautions should be taken before initiating an upgrade:

- Plan for an appropriate downtime window.
- Ensure that your data is stored in Azure before disconnecting any clients writing to Data Box Gateway. You can validate that data transfer is complete by ensuring that all top-level directories in the Data Box Gateway's share have the 'offline' attribute enabled.

All the release noted issues are carried forward from the previous releases. For a list of known issues, see [Known issues in the GA release](data-box-gateway-release-notes.md#known-issues-in-ga-release).
