## Prerequisites

Here you find the configuration prerequisites for your Data Box Gateway resource, your Data Box Gateway device, and the datacenter network.

### For the Data Box Gateway resource

Before you begin, make sure that:

* Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/).
* You have owner or contributor access at resource group level for the Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources.
    - To create any Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway resource, you should have permissions as a contributor (or higher) scoped at resource group level. You also need to make sure that the `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge` provider is registered. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](data-box-gateway-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).
    - To create a Storage account resource, again you need contributor or higher access scoped at the resource group level. Azure Storage is by default a registered resource provider.
- You have admin or user access to Microsoft Graph API. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
- You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.

### For the Data Box Gateway device

Before you deploy a virtual device, make sure that:

- You have access to a host system running Hyper-V on Windows Server 2012 R2 or later or VMware ESXi 6.7, 7.0, or 8.0 that can be used to a provision a device.
- The host system is able to dedicate the following resources to provision your Data Box virtual device:
  
  - A minimum of 4 virtual processors.
  - At least 8 GB of RAM. We strongly recommend at least 16 GB of RAM.
  - One network interface.
  - A 250 GB OS disk.
  - A 2 TB virtual disk for system data.

### For the datacenter network

Before you begin, make sure that:

- The network in your datacenter is configured as per the networking requirements for your Data Box Gateway device. For more information, see the [Data Box Gateway system requirements](data-box-gateway-system-requirements.md).

- For normal operating conditions of your Data Box Gateway, you should have a:

    - A minimum of 10-Mbps download bandwidth to ensure the device stays updated.
    - A minimum of 20-Mbps dedicated upload and download bandwidth to transfer files.

## Create a new resource

If you have an existing Data Box Gateway resource to manage your virtual devices, skip this step and go to [Get the activation key](#get-the-activation-key).

To create a Data Box Gateway resource, take the following steps in the Azure portal.

1. Use your Microsoft Azure credentials to sign in to either of these portals:

    - The Azure portal at this URL: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
    - The Azure Government portal at this URL: [https://portal.azure.us](https://portal.azure.us). For details, go to [Connect to Azure Government using the portal](../azure-government/documentation-government-get-started-connect-with-portal.md).

1. Select **+ Create a resource**.
