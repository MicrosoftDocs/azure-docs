# Troubleshoot your Azure Data Box Gateway issues

This article describes how to troubleshoot issues on your Azure Data Box Gateway.
In this article, you learn how to:

> * Collect Support package
> * Use logs to troubleshoot

## Run diagnostics

To diagnose and troubleshoot any device errors, you can run the diagnostics tests. Do the following steps in the local web UI of your device to run diagnostic tests.

1. In the local web UI, go to **Troubleshooting > Diagnostic tests**. Select the test you want to run and click **Run test**. This runs the tests to diagnose any possible issues with your network, device, web proxy, time, or cloud settings. You are notified that the device is running tests.

2. After the tests have completed, the results are displayed. If a test fails, then a URL for recommended action is presented. You can click the URL to view the recommended action.

## Collect Support package

A log package is composed of all the relevant logs that can help Microsoft Support troubleshoot any device issues. You can generate a log package via the local web UI. 

Do the following steps to collect a Support package. 

1. In the local web UI, go to **Troubleshooting > Support**. Click **Create support package**. The system starts collecting support package. The package collection may take several minutes.

2. After the Support package is created, click **Download Support package**. A zipped package is downloaded on the path you chose. You can unzip the package.

## Use logs to troubleshoot

Any errors experienced during the upload and refresh processes are included in the respective error files.

1. To view the error files, go to your share and click the share to view the contents. 

      ![Click add user 5](media/data-box-gateway-troubleshoot/troubleshoot-logs-1.png)

2. Click the _Microsoft Data Box Gateway folder_. This folder has two subfolders:

   - Upload folder that has log files for upload errors.
   - Refresh folder for errors during refresh.

     Here is a sample log file for refresh.

     ```
     <root container="brownbag1" machine="VM15BS020663" timestamp="07/18/2018 00:11:10" />
     <file item="test.txt" local="False" remote="True" error="16001" />
     <summary runtime="00:00:00.0945320" errors="1" creates="2" deletes="0" insync="3" replaces="0" pending="9" />
     ``` 

3. When you see an error in this file (highlighted in the sample), note down the error code, in this case it is 16001. Look up the description of this error code against the following error reference.
