Collects and uploads Linux VM's system performance, diagnostic and syslog data to user’s storage table.2.	Enables user to customize the data metrics that will be collected and uploaded.	3.	Enables user to upload specified log files to designated storage table.For version 2.0, the data includes:1.	All Linux Rsyslog loggings, including system, security and application logs.2.	All system data specified in this [doc.](https://scx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=xplatproviders&referringTitle=Documentation "document")3.	User specified log files.##How to enable the extension The extension can be enabled through Azure management portal, Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI scripts. To view and configure the system and performance data directly from the [Azure Management portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#), please follow these [steps](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/09/02/windows-azure-virtual-machine-monitoring-with-wad-extension/ "URL to the Windows blog"). This article will focus on enabling and configuring the extension through Azure CLI commands.This allows you to read and view the data from the storage table directly.##Prerequisites1. Microsoft Azure Linux Agent version 2.0.6 or later. Note most Azure VM Linux gallery images included version 2.0.6 above. You can run WAAgent -version to confirm the version installed in the VM. If the VM is running a version earlier than 2.0.6 you can follow these [instructions](https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent "instructions") to update it.2.  [Azure CLI](./xplat-cli.md "Azure CLI")  Please follow [this Guidance](./xplat-cli-install.md "this Guidance") to setup the Azure CLI environment on your machine. Once the Azure CLI has been installed, you will be able to use the azure command from your command-line interface (Bash, Terminal, Command prompt) to access the Azure CLI commands; For example, run ‘azure vm extension set --help’ for detailed usage, run ‘azure login’ to Login to Azure, run ‘azure vm list’ to list all the virtual machines you have on azure.3. Storage account to store the data. You will need a pre-created storage account name and access key to upload the data to your storage.##Use Azure CLI command to enable Linux Diagnostic Extension ###  Scenario 1. Enable the extension with default data setFor version 2.0 and above, the default data that will be collected includes: 1. All Rsyslog information (including system, security and application logs)  2. A core set of basis system data, note the full data set is described in this [document](https://scx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=xplatproviders&referringTitle=Documentation "document").If you want to enable extra data, please continue with steps in scenario 2 and 3.Step 1. Create a file named PrivateConfig.json with following content:	{     	"storageAccountName":"the storage account to receive data",     	"storageAccountKey":"the key of the account"	}Step 2. Run ‘azure vm extension set vm_name LinuxDiagnostic Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 2.* --private-config-path PrivateConfig.json’. ###   Scenario 2. Customize performance monitor metric  If you want to customize the table of the performance and diagnostic data, follow steps below.Step 1. Create a file named PrivateConfig.json with following contents, specify the particular data you want to collect.For all supported providers and variables, reference this [document](https://scx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=xplatproviders&referringTitle=Documentation "document"). You can have multiple queries and store them into multiple tables by appending more queries into the script.Note by default, the Rsyslog data will always be collected.	{     	"storageAccountName":"storage account to receive data",     	"storageAccountKey":"key of the account",      	"perfCfg":[           	{"query":"SELECT PercentAvailableMemory, AvailableMemory, UsedMemory ,PercentUsedSwap FROM SCX_MemoryStatisticalInformation","table":"LinuxMemory"           	}             ]	}Step 2. Run ‘azure vm extension set vm_name LinuxDiagnostic Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 2.*--private-config-path PrivateConfig.json’ ###   Scenario 3. Uploading your own log filesIf you want to collect particular log files and upload to your storage account, follow below steps. You need to specify the path to your log file, and the table name to store your log. You can have multiple log files by adding multiple file/table entries to the script.Step 1. Create a file named PrivateConfig.json with following content: 	{     	"storageAccountName":"the storage account to receive data",     	"storageAccountKey":"key of the account",      	"fileCfg":[           	{"file":"/var/log/mysql.err",             "table":"mysqlerr"           	}           ]	}Step 2. Run ‘azure vm extension set vm_name LinuxDiagnostic Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 2.*--private-config-path PrivateConfig.json’ ###   Scenario 4. Disable Linux monitor extensionStep 1. Create a file named PrivateConfig.json with following content:	{     	"storageAccountName":"the storage account to receive data",     	"storageAccountKey":"the key of the account",     	“perfCfg”:[],     	“enableSyslog”:”False”	}Step 2. Run ‘azure vm extension set vm_name LinuxDiagnostic Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 2.*   --private-config-path PrivateConfig.json’ ##Review your dataThe performance and diagnostic data are stored in Azure storage table, check out [this article](./storage-ruby-how-to-use-table-storage.md "this article") on how to access the data in the storage table using Azure CLI scripts.In addition, you can use following UI tools to access the data:1.	Use Visual Studio Server Explorer. Navigate to your storage account. After the VM has been running about 5 minutes you should see the default tables. “LinuxCpu”,”LinuxDisk”,”LinuxMemory”,”Linuxsyslog”. Double click the table name to view the data. 2.	Use [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azurestorageexplorer.codeplex.com/ "Azure Storage Explorer") to access the data. ![image](./media/monitor/no1.png)If have enabled fileCfg or perfCfg specified in Scenario 2 and 3, you will also be able to view non-default data from the above tools.##Known Issues1. For version 2.0, the Rsyslog information and customer specified log file can only be accessed via scripting.
2. For version 2.0, if you have enabled the Linux Diagnostic extension via script first, then you cannot view the data from portal. On the other hand,  if you enable the extension from portal first, then the scripts will still work.
We expect to fix both issues in next release.
