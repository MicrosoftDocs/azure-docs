> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Playwright Testing is currently in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites  

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Create a workspace

To get started with running your Playwright tests on cloud browsers, you first create a Microsoft Playwright Testing workspace. You can create a workspace in either the Azure portal or the Playwright portal.

# [Playwright portal](#tab/playwright)

When you create a workspace in the Playwright portal, the service creates a new resource group and a Microsoft Playwright Testing Azure resource in your Azure subscription. The name of the new resource group is based on the workspace name.

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Select the menu button in the upper-left corner of the portal, and then select **Create a resource** a resource.

1. Provide the following information to configure a new Microsoft Playwright Testing workspace:

    |Field  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Subscription**     | Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for this Microsoft Playwright Testing workspace. |
    |**Resource group**     | Select an existing resource group. Or select **Create new**, and then enter a unique name for the new resource group.        |
    |**Name**     | Enter a unique name to identify your workspace.<BR>The name can only consist of alphanumerical characters, and have a length between 3 and 64 characters. |
    |**Location**     | Select a geographic location to host your workspace. <BR>This location also determines where the test execution results and related artifacts are stored. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > Optionally, you can configure more details on the **Tags** tab. Tags are name/value pairs that enable you to categorize resources and view consolidated billing by applying the same tag to multiple resources and resource groups.

1. After you're finished configuring the resource, select **Review + Create**.

1. Review all the configuration settings and select **Create** to start the deployment of the Microsoft Playwright Testing workspace.

    When the process has finished, a deployment success message appears.

## Display the workspace activity log

You can view the list of test runs for the workspace in the Playwright portal. Microsoft Playwright Testing only stores test run metadata, and doesn't store the test code, test results, trace files, or other artifacts.

The workspace activity log lists for each test run the following details: 

- Total test duration of the test suite
- Maximum number of parallel browsers
- Total time across all parallel browsers. This is the time  that you're billed for the test run.

To view the list of test runs in the Playwright portal:

1. Sign in to the [Playwright portal](https://aka.ms/mpt/portal) with your Azure account.

1. Optionally, switch to another workspace by selecting your current workspace in the top of the screen, and then select **Manage all workspaces**.

1. On the workspace home page, you can view the workspace activity log.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-playwright-workspace/playwright-testing-activity-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the activity log for a workspace in the Playwright Testing portal." lightbox="./media/how-to-manage-playwright-workspace/playwright-testing-activity-log.png":::

## Delete a workspace
