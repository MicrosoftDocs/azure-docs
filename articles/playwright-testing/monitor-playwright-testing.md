# Monitoring Microsoft Playwright Testing Preview

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data generated by Microsoft Playwright Testing Preview.

Microsoft Playwright Testing creates monitoring data using [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview), which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure. Azure Monitor provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources. It can also monitor resources in other clouds and on-premises. Learn more about [monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource).

> [!TIP]
> To understand costs associated with Azure Monitor, see [Usage and estimated costs](/azure/azure-monitor//usage-estimated-costs). To understand the time it takes for your data to appear in Azure Monitor, see [Log data ingestion time](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-ingestion-time).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Playwright Testing is currently in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Monitoring data 

Microsoft Playwright Testing collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-azure-resources).

See [Monitor Microsoft Playwright Testing data reference](./monitor-playwright-testing-reference.md) for detailed information on logs metrics created by Microsoft Playwright Testing.

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting. Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect.

The log categories for Microsoft Playwright Testing are listed in [Monitor Microsoft Playwright Testing data reference](./monitor-playwright-testing-reference.md#resource-logs).

## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties. All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema).

You can find the schema for Microsoft Playwright Testing resource logs in the [Monitor Microsoft Playwright Testing data reference](monitor-playwright-testing-reference.md#resource-logs).

The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) is a type of Azure platform log that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of resource logs types collected for Microsoft Playwright Testing, see [Monitor Microsoft Playwright Testing data reference](monitor-playwright-testing-reference.md#resource-logs).
