# Try Microsoft Playwright Testing Preview for free

Microsoft Playwright Testing Preview is a fully managed service for end-to-end testing built on top of Playwright. With the free trial, you can try Microsoft Playwright Testing for free for 30 days, 100 test minutes, and 1,000 test results. In this article, you learn about the limits of the free trial, how to get started, and how to track your free trial usage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Playwright Testing is currently in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* Your Azure account needs the [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor), or one of the [classic administrator roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles).

## Limits to free trial

The following table lists the limits for the Microsoft Playwright Testing free trial.

| Resource | Limit |
|-|-|
| Duration of trial | 30 days |
| Total test minutes¹ | 100 minutes |
| Total test results¹ | 1,000 results |
| Number of workspaces²³ | 1 |

¹ If your usage exceeds either the free test minute limit or the free test result limit, only the overage counts toward the pay-as-you-go billing model. The two features are billed separately. See [Microsoft Playwright Testing preview pricing](https://aka.ms/mpt/pricing)

² These limits only apply to the *first* workspace you create in your Azure subscription. Any subsequent workspaces you create in the subscription automatically uses the pay-as-you-go billing model.

³ If you delete the free trial workspace, you can't create a new free trial workspace anymore.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you exceed any of these limits, the workspace is automatically converted to the pay-as-you-go billing model. Learn more about the [Microsoft Playwright Testing pricing](https://aka.ms/mpt/pricing).

## Create a workspace

The first time you create a workspace in your Azure subscription, the workspace is automatically enrolled in the free trial. 

To create a workspace in the Playwright portal:

1. Sign in to the [Playwright portal](https://aka.ms/mpt/portal) with your Azure account.

1. Select **Create workspace**.

    If this is the first workspace you create in the Azure subscription, you see a message that the workspace is eligible for the free trial.
