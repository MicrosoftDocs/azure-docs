# Pricing

Cloud Shell is a free service. You only pay for the underlying Azure resources that are consumed.

## Compute cost

Azure Cloud Shell runs on a machine provided for free by Azure. If you need file persistence,
Cloud Shell requires a Microsoft Azure Files share.

## Storage cost

If you would like to persist files across sessions, Cloud Shell requires a new or existing Azure
Files share to be mounted. Storage incurs regular costs. For pricing information, see
[Azure Files Pricing][01].

## Network costs

For standard Cloud Shell sessions, there are no network costs.

If you have deployed Azure Cloud Shell in a private virtual network, you pay for network resources.
For pricing information, see [Virtual Network Pricing][02].
