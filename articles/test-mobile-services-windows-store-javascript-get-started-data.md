<p>This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to leverage data in a Windows Store app. In this tutorial, you will download a Visual Studio 2013 project for an app that stores data in memory, create a new mobile service, integrate the mobile service with the app, and then login to the Azure Management Portal to view changes to data made when running the app.</p>

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
<p>This tutorial requires Visual Studio 2013, which makes it easier to connect your Windows Store app to Mobile Services. To complete the same basic procedure using Visual Studio 2012, follow the steps in the topic <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-js-vs2012/">Get started with data in Mobile Services using Visual Studio 2012</a>.</p>
</div>

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps:

1. [Download the Windows Store app project][Get the Windows Store app] 
2. [Create the mobile service]
3. [Add a data table for storage]
4. [Update the app to use Mobile Services]
5. [Test the app against Mobile Services]

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong> <p>To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A756A2826&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowsazure.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started-with-data-js%2F" target="_blank">Azure Free Trial</a>.</p></div> 

<h2><a name="download-app"></a><span class="short-header">Download the project</span>Download the GetStartedWithData project</h2>

This tutorial is built on the [GetStartedWithMobileServices app][Developer Code Samples site], which is a Windows Store app project in Visual Studio 2013. The UI for this app is identical to the app generated by the Mobile Services quickstart, except that added items are stored locally in memory.  

1. Download the JavaScript version of the GetStartedWithData sample app from the [Developer Code Samples site]. 

   	![][10]

2. In Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8, open the downloaded project, expand the **js** folder and examine the default.js file.

   	Notice that added **TodoItem** objects are stored in an in-memory **List** object.

3. Press the **F5** key to rebuild the project and start the app.

4. In the app, type some text in **Insert a TodoItem**, then click **Save**.

   	![][0]  

   	Notice that the saved text is displayed in the second column under **Query and update data**.

<h2><a name="create-service"></a><span class="short-header">Create the mobile service</span>Create a new mobile service from Visual Studio</h2>

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-vs2013](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-vs2013.md)]

<ol start="7">
<li><p>In Solution Explorer, expand the **services**, **mobile services**, **&lt;your_service&gt;** folders, open the service.js script file, and notice the new global variable, which looks like the following example:</p> 

		<pre><code>var todolistClient = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient(
                "https://todolist.azure-mobile.net/",
		        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX");</code></pre>

	<p>This code provides access to your new mobile service in your app by using a global variable. The client is created by supplying the URI and the application key of the new mobile service. Because a reference to this script was was added to the default.html file, this variable is available to all script files that are also referenced from this page.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="add-table"></a><span class="short-header">Add a new table</span>Add a new table to the mobile service and update the app</h2>

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-table-vs2013](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-table-vs2013.md)]

6. In the default.js script file, comment the line that defines the existing items collection, then uncomment or add the following line of code and replace `<yourClient>;` with the variable added to the service.js file when you connected your project to the mobile service:

		var todoTable = <yourClient>.getTable('TodoItem');

   	This code creates a proxy object (**todoTable**) for the new database table. 

7. Replace the **InsertTodoItem** function with the following code:

		var insertTodoItem = function (todoItem) {
		    // Inserts a new row into the database. When the operation completes
		    // and Mobile Services has assigned an id, the item is added to the binding list.
		    todoTable.insert(todoItem).done(function (item) {
		        todoItems.push(item);
		    });
		};

	This code inserts a new item into the table.

	<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong><p>New tables are created with only an Id column. When dynamic schema is enabled, Mobile Services automatically generates new columns based on the JSON object in the insert or update request. For more information, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj193175.aspx">Dynamic schema</a>.</p></div>

8. Replace the **RefreshTodoItems** function with the following code:

		var refreshTodoItems = function () {
		    // This code refreshes the entries in the list by querying the table. 
		    todoTable.read().done(function (results) {
		        todoItems = new WinJS.Binding.List(results);
		        listItems.winControl.itemDataSource = todoItems.dataSource;
		    });
		};

   	This sets the binding to the collection of items in the todoTable, which contains all of the **TodoItem** objects returned from the mobile service. 

9. Replace the **UpdateCheckedTodoItem** function with the following code:
        
        var updateCheckedTodoItem = function (todoItem) {
            // This code takes a freshly completed TodoItem and updates the database. 
            todoTable.update(todoItem);
        };

   	This sends an item update to the mobile service.

Now that the app has been updated to use Mobile Services for backend storage, it's time to test the app against Mobile Services.

<h2><a name="test-app"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test the app against your new mobile service</h2>

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. As before, type text in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.

   	This sends a new item as an insert to the mobile service.

3. In the [Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

4. Click the **Data** tab, then click **Browse**.

   	![][9]
  
   	Notice that the **TodoItem** table now contains data, with id values generated by Mobile Services, and that columns have been automatically added to the table to match the TodoItem class in the app.

5. In the app, check one of the items in the list, then go back to the Browse tab in the portal and click **Refresh**. 

  	Notice that the complete value has changed from **false** to **true**.

6. In the default.js project file, replace the existing **RefreshTodoItems** function with the following code that filters out completed items:

        var refreshTodoItems = function () {                     
            // More advanced query that filters out completed items. 
            todoTable.where({ complete: false })
               .read()
               .done(function (results) {
                   todoItems = new WinJS.Binding.List(results);
                   listItems.winControl.itemDataSource = todoItems.dataSource;
               });            
        };

7. In the app, check another one of the items in the list and then click the **Refresh** button.

   	Notice that the checked item now disappears from the list. Each refresh results in a round-trip to the mobile service, which now returns filtered data.

This concludes the **Get started with data** tutorial.
