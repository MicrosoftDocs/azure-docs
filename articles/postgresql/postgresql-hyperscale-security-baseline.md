# Azure security baseline for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL server firewall prevents all access to your Hyperscale (Citus) coordinator node until you specify which computers have permission. The firewall grants access to the server based on the originating IP address of each request. To configure your firewall, you create firewall rules that specify ranges of acceptable IP addresses. You can create firewall rules at the server level.

## Logging and monitoring

*For more information, see [Security control: Logging and monitoring](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: For control plane audit logging, enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your Azure resources.

Also, ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by Hyperscale (Citus). Within the Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspace(s) to query and perform analytics, and use storage accounts for long-term/archival storage. Alternatively, you may enable, and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM).

### 9.3: Validate all backups including customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: In Azure Database for PostgreSQL, restoring a Hyperscale (Citus) cluster creates a new cluster from the original nodes' backups. You can restore a cluster to any point in time within the last 35 days. The restore process creates a new cluster in the same Azure region, subscription, and resource group as the original. The new cluster configuration is the same as the original cluster configuration: the same number of nodes, number of vCores, storage size, and user roles.

Firewall settings and PostgreSQL server parameters are not preserved from the original server group; they are reset to default values. The firewall will prevent all connections. You will need to manually adjust these settings after restore.

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Deleted Hyperscale (Citus) clusters can't be restored. If you delete the cluster, all nodes that belong to the cluster are deleted and can't be recovered. To protect cluster resources post-deployment from accidental deletion or unexpected changes, administrators can leverage management locks.

## Incident response

*For more information, see [Security control: Incident response](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert. 

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that the customer's data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party.  Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.
