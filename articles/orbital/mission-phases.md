# Mission Phases

Azure Orbital Ground Station provides easy and secure access to communication products and services required to support all phases of satellite missions.

## Pre-launch

- [Initiate ground station licensing](initiate-licensing.md) ahead of launch to ensure you can communicate with your spacecraft.
- [Create and authorize a spacecraft](register-spacecraft.md) resource for your satellite.
- [Prepare your network](prepare-network.md) to send and receive data between the spacecraft and Azure Orbital Ground Station.
- [Configure a contact profile](contact-profile.md) with links and channels.
- [Add a modem configuration file](modem-chain.md) to the contact profile.
- [Prepare for launch](prepare-for-launch.md) with RF compatibility testing and enrollment in Launch Window Scheduling (in preview).

## Launch and nominal operations

- [Schedule contacts](schedule-contact.md) with your spacecraft.
- Keep the [spacecraft TLE](update-tle.md) up to date.
- [Receive real-time antenna telemetry](receive-real-time-telemetry.md) from ground station passes.
- [Use sample queries](resource-graph-samples.md) for Azure Resource Graph.
