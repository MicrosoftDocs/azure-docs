# Mount an Azure file share in Azure Container Instances

By default, Azure Container Instances are stateless. If the container crashes or stops, all of its state is lost. To persist state beyond the lifetime of the container, you must mount a volume from an external store. This article shows how to mount an Azure file share for use with Azure Container Instances.

> [!NOTE]
> Mounting an Azure Files share is currently restricted to Linux containers. While we are working to bring all features to Windows containers, you can find current platform differences in [Quotas and region availability for Azure Container Instances](container-instances-quotas.md).

## Create an Azure file share

Before using an Azure file share with Azure Container Instances, you must create it. Run the following script to create a storage account to host the file share, and the share itself. The storage account name must be globally unique, so the script adds a random value to the base string.

```azurecli-interactive
# Change these four parameters as needed
ACI_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP=myResourceGroup
ACI_PERS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=mystorageaccount$RANDOM
ACI_PERS_LOCATION=eastus
ACI_PERS_SHARE_NAME=acishare

# Create the storage account with the parameters
az storage account create \
    --resource-group $ACI_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $ACI_PERS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --location $ACI_PERS_LOCATION \
    --sku Standard_LRS

# Export the connection string as an environment variable. The following 'az storage share create' command
# references this environment variable when creating the Azure file share.
export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=`az storage account show-connection-string --resource-group $ACI_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP --name $ACI_PERS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --output tsv`

# Create the file share
az storage share create -n $ACI_PERS_SHARE_NAME
```

## Get storage credentials

To mount an Azure file share as a volume in Azure Container Instances, you need three values: the storage account name, the share name, and the storage access key.

If you used the script above, the storage account name was created with a random value at the end. To query the final string (including the random portion), use the following commands:

```azurecli-interactive
STORAGE_ACCOUNT=$(az storage account list --resource-group $ACI_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP --query "[?contains(name,'$ACI_PERS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME')].[name]" --output tsv)
echo $STORAGE_ACCOUNT
```

The share name is already known (defined as *acishare* in the script above), so all that remains is the storage account key, which can be found using the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
STORAGE_KEY=$(az storage account keys list --resource-group $ACI_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT --query "[0].value" --output tsv)
echo $STORAGE_KEY
```

## Deploy container and mount volume

To mount an Azure file share as a volume in a container, specify the share and volume mount point when you create the container with [az container create][az-container-create]. If you've followed the previous steps, you can mount the share you created earlier by using the following command to create a container:

```azurecli-interactive
az container create \
    --resource-group $ACI_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name hellofiles \
    --image microsoft/aci-hellofiles \
    --dns-name-label aci-demo \
    --ports 80 \
    --azure-file-volume-account-name $ACI_PERS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --azure-file-volume-account-key $STORAGE_KEY \
    --azure-file-volume-share-name $ACI_PERS_SHARE_NAME \
    --azure-file-volume-mount-path /aci/logs/
```

The `--dns-name-label` value must be unique within the Azure region you create the container instance. Update the value in the preceding command if you receive a **DNS name label** error message when you execute the command.

## Manage files in mounted volume

Once the container starts up, you can use the simple web app deployed via the [microsoft/aci-hellofiles][aci-hellofiles] image to manage the files in the Azure file share at the mount path you specified. Obtain the web app's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) with the [az container show][az-container-show] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az container show --resource-group $ACI_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP --name hellofiles --query ipAddress.fqdn
```

You can use the [Azure portal][portal] or a tool like the [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer][storage-explorer] to retrieve and inspect the file written to the file share.

## Mount multiple volumes

To mount multiple volumes in a container instance, you must deploy using an [Azure Resource Manager template](/azure/templates/microsoft.containerinstance/containergroups).

First, provide the share details and define the volumes by populating the `volumes` array in the `properties` section of the template. For example, if you've created two Azure Files shares named *share1* and *share2* in storage account *myStorageAccount*, the `volumes` array would appear similar to the following:

```json
"volumes": [{
  "name": "myvolume1",
  "azureFile": {
    "shareName": "share1",
    "storageAccountName": "myStorageAccount",
    "storageAccountKey": "<storage-account-key>"
  }
},
{
  "name": "myvolume2",
  "azureFile": {
    "shareName": "share2",
    "storageAccountName": "myStorageAccount",
    "storageAccountKey": "<storage-account-key>"
  }
}]
```

Next, for each container in the container group in which you'd like to mount the volumes, populate the `volumeMounts` array in the `properties` section of the container definition. For example, this mounts the two volumes, *myvolume1* and *myvolume2*, previously defined:

```json
"volumeMounts": [{
  "name": "myvolume1",
  "mountPath": "/mnt/share1/"
},
{
  "name": "myvolume2",
  "mountPath": "/mnt/share2/"
}]
```

To see an example of container instance deployment with an Azure Resource Manager template, see [Deploy multi-container groups in Azure Container Instances](container-instances-multi-container-group.md).
