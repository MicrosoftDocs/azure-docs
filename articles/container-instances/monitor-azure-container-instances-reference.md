# Container Instances monitoring data reference

<!-- Intro. Required. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Container Instances](monitor-azure-container-instances.md) for details on the data you can collect for Container Instances and how to use it.

<!-- ## Metrics. Required section. -->

### Supported metrics for Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups resource type.

### Supported metrics for Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerScaleSets
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerScaleSets resource type.

| Dimension Name | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **containerName** | The name of the container. The name must be between 1 and 63 characters long. It can contain only lowercase letters numbers, and dashes. Dashes can't begin or end the name, and dashes can't be consecutive. The name must be unique in its resource group. |

<!-- ## Resource logs. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs.md)]

### Supported resource logs for Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
[!INCLUDE [microsoft-containerinstance-containergroups-logs](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/microsoft-containerinstance-containergroups-logs-include.md)]

<!-- ## Azure Monitor Logs tables. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables.md)]

Container Instances has two table schemas, a legacy schema for Log Analytics and a new schema that supports diagnostic settings. Diagnostic settings is in public preview in the Azure portal. You can use either or both schemas at the same time.

### Legacy Log Analytics tables

The following *_CL* tables represent the legacy Log Analytics integration. Users provide the Log Analytics workspace ID and key in the Container Group payload.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the columns in the following list exist only as part of the schema, and don't have any data emitted in logs. These columns are denoted with a description of 'Empty'.

#### ContainerInstanceLog_CL

| Column | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
|Computer|string|Empty|
|ContainerGroup_s|string|The name of the container group associated with the record|
|ContainerID_s|string|A unique identifier for the container associated with the record|
|ContainerImage_s|string|The name of the container image associated with the record|
|Location_s|string|The location of the resource associated with the record|
|Message|string|If applicable, the message from the container|
|OSType_s|string|The name of the operating system the container is based on|
|RawData|string|Empty|

|Source_s|string|Name of the logging component, "LoggingAgent"|
|SubscriptionId|string|A unique identifier for the subscription that the record is associated with|
|TimeGenerated|datetime|Timestamp when the event was generated by the Azure service processing the request corresponding the event|
|Type|string|The name of the table|
|_ResourceId|string|A unique identifier for the resource that the record is associated with|
|_SubscriptionId|string|A unique identifier for the subscription that the record is associated with|

#### ContainerEvent_CL

|Column|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Computer|string|Empty|
|ContainerGroupInstanceId_g|string|A unique identifier for the container group associated with the record|
|ContainerGroup_s|string|The name of the container group associated with the record|
|ContainerName_s|string|The name of the container associated with the record|
|Count_d|real|How many times the event has occurred since the last poll|
|FirstTimestamp_t|datetime|The timestamp of the first time the event occurred|
|Location_s|string|The location of the resource associated with the record|
|Message|string|If applicable, the message from the container|
|OSType_s|string|The name of the operating system the container is based on|

### Azure Monitor Log Analytics tables

The newer tables require use of a diagnostic setting to route information to Log Analytics. Diagnostic settings for Container Instances in the Azure portal is in public preview. The table names are similar, but without the _CL, and some columns are different. For more information, see [Use diagnostic settings](container-instances-log-analytics.md#using-diagnostic-settings).

#### Container Instances
Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
- [ContainerInstanceLog](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/containerinstancelog)
- [ContainerEvent](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/containerevent)

<!-- ## Activity log. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-activity-log](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-activity-log.md)]
