# Apache Kafka developer guide for Azure Event Hubs
This article provides links to articles that describe how to integrate your Apache Kafka applications with Azure Event Hubs. 

## Overview
Event Hubs provides a Kafka endpoint that your existing Kafka based applications can use as an alternative to running your own Kafka cluster. Event Hubs works with many of your existing Kafka applications. For more information, see [Event Hubs for Apache Kafka](azure-event-hubs-apache-kafka-overview.md)

## Quickstarts
You can find quickstarts in GitHub and in this content set that helps you quickly ramp up on Event Hubs for Kafka.

### Quickstarts in GitHub
See the following quickstarts in the **azure-event-hubs-for-kafka** repo: 

| Client language/framework | Description | 
| ------------------------- | ----------- | 
| [.NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/tree/master/quickstart/dotnet) | <p>This quickstart shows how to create and connect to an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint using an example producer and consumer written in C# using .NET Core 2.0.</p><p>This sample is based on [Confluent's Apache Kafka .NET client](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet), modified for use with Event Hubs for Kafka.</p> | 
| [Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/tree/master/quickstart/java) | This quickstart shows how to create and connect to an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint using an example producer and consumer written in Java. |

| [Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/tree/master/quickstart/python) | <p>This quickstart shows how to create and connect to an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint using an example producer and consumer written in python.</p><p>This sample is based on [Confluent's Apache Kafka Python client](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python), modified for use with Event Hubs for Kafka.</p>|
| [Go](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/tree/master/quickstart/go) | <p>This quickstart shows how to create and connect to an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint using an example producer and consumer written in Go.</p><p>This sample is based on [Confluent's Apache Kafka Golang client](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go), modified for use with Event Hubs for Kafka.</p>| 
| [Sarama kafka Go](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/tree/master/quickstart/go-sarama-client) | This quickstart shows how to create and connect to an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint using an example producer and consumer written in Go using the [Sarama Kafka client](https://github.com/Shopify/sarama) library. |
| [Kafka](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/tree/master/quickstart/kafka-cli) | This quickstart shows how to create and connect to an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint using the CLI that comes bundled with the Apache Kafka distribution.| 
| [kcat](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/tree/master/quickstart/kafkacat) | kcat is a non-JVM command-line consumer and producer based on librdkafka, popular due to its speed and small footprint. This quickstart contains a sample configuration and several simple sample kafkacat commands. | 
 
### Quickstarts in DOCS
See the quickstart: [Data streaming with Event Hubs using the Kafka protocol](event-hubs-quickstart-kafka-enabled-event-hubs.md) in this content set, which provides step-by-step instructions on how to stream into Event Hubs. You learn how to use your producers and consumers to talk to Event Hubs with just a configuration change in your applications. 


## Tutorials 

### Tutorials in GitHub
See the following tutorials on GitHub:

| Tutorial | Description | 
| ------------------------- | ----------- | 
| [Akka](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/tree/master/tutorials/akka/java) | This tutorial shows how to connect Akka Streams to Kafka-enabled Event Hubs without changing your protocol clients or running your own clusters. There are two separate tutorials using **Java** and **Scala** programming languages. | 
| [Connect](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/tree/master/tutorials/connect) | This document walks you through integrating Kafka Connect with Azure Event Hubs and deploying basic FileStreamSource and FileStreamSink connectors. While these connectors aren't meant for production use, they demonstrate an end-to-end Kafka Connect Scenario where Azure Event Hubs masquerades as a Kafka broker.| 
| [Filebeat](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/tree/master/tutorials/filebeat) | This document walks you through integrating Filebeat and Event Hubs via Filebeat's Kafka output. |
