# Monitor Azure Event Hubs

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-intro.md)]

Azure Monitor documentation describes the following concepts:

- What is Azure Monitor?
- Costs associated with monitoring
- Monitoring data collected in Azure
- Configuring data collection
- Standard tools in Azure for analyzing and alerting on monitoring data

The following sections describe the specific data gathered for Azure Event Hubs. These sections also provide examples for configuring data collection and analyzing this data with Azure tools.

> [!TIP]
> To understand costs associated with Azure Monitor, see [Azure Monitor cost and usage](/azure/azure-monitor/cost-usage). To understand the time it takes for your data to appear in Azure Monitor, see [Log data ingestion time](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-ingestion-time).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-types](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-types.md)]
For more information about the resource types for Event Hubs, see [Azure Event Hubs monitoring data reference](monitor-event-hubs-reference.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-data-storage](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-data-storage.md)]

- Azure Storage

  If you use Azure Storage to store the diagnostic logging information, the information is stored in containers named *insights-logs-operationlogs* and *insights-metrics-pt1m*. Sample URL for an operation log: `https://<Azure Storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/insights-logs-operationallogs/resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/<Azure subscription ID>/RESOURCEGROUPS/<Resource group name>/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.EVENTHUB/NAMESPACES/<Namespace name>/y=<YEAR>/m=<MONTH-NUMBER>/d=<DAY-NUMBER>/h=<HOUR>/m=<MINUTE>/PT1H.json`. The URL for a metric log is similar.

- Azure Event Hubs

  If you use Azure Event Hubs to store the diagnostic logging information, the information is stored in Event Hubs instances named *insights-logs-operationlogs* and *insights-metrics-pt1m*. You can also select an existing event hub except for the event hub for which you're configuring diagnostic settings.

- Log Analytics

  If you use Log Analytics to store the diagnostic logging information, the information is stored in tables named *AzureDiagnostics / AzureMetrics* or resource specific tables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling these settings requires additional Azure services: storage account, event hub, or Log Analytics. These services might increase your cost. To calculate an estimated cost, visit the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator).

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable metrics in a diagnostic setting, dimension information is not currently included as part of the information sent to a storage account, event hub, or log analytics.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-platform-metrics](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-platform-metrics.md)]

Resource Logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for Azure Event Hubs are listed in [Azure Event Hubs monitoring data reference](monitor-event-hubs-reference.md#resource-logs).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Monitor doesn't include dimensions in the exported metrics data that's sent to a destination like Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and Log Analytics.

For a list of available metrics for Event Hubs, see [Azure Event Hubs monitoring data reference](monitor-event-hubs-reference.md#metrics).

### Analyze metrics

You can analyze metrics for Azure Event Hubs, along with metrics from other Azure services, by selecting **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** section on the home page for your Event Hubs namespace. See [Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics) for details on using this tool. For a list of the platform metrics collected, see [Monitoring Azure Event Hubs data reference metrics](monitor-event-hubs-reference.md#metrics).

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-event-hubs/metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Metrics Explorer for an Event Hubs namespace." lightbox="./media/monitor-event-hubs/metrics.png":::

For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported).

> [!TIP]
> Azure Monitor metrics data is available for 90 days. However, when creating charts only 30 days can be visualized. For example, if you want to visualize a 90 day period, you must break it into three charts of 30 days within the 90 day period.

### Filter and split

For metrics that support dimensions, you can apply filters using a dimension value. For example, add a filter with `EntityName` set to the name of an event hub. You can also split a metric by dimension to visualize how different segments of the metric compare with each other. For more information of filtering and splitting, see [Advanced features of Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts).

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-event-hubs/metrics-filter-split.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Metrics Explorer for an Event Hubs namespace with a filter." lightbox="./media/monitor-event-hubs/metrics-filter-split.png":::

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-logs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-logs.md)]

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and the log schemas for Event Hubs, see [Azure Event Hubs monitoring data reference](monitor-event-hubs-reference.md#resource-logs).

### Analyze logs

Using Azure Monitor Log Analytics requires you to create a diagnostic configuration and enable **Send information to Log Analytics**. For more information, see the [Metrics](#azure-monitor-platform-metrics) section. Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables, with each table having its own set of unique properties. Azure Event Hubs has the capability to dispatch logs to either of two destination tables: Azure Diagnostic or Resource specific tables in Log Analytics. For a detailed reference of the logs and metrics, see [Azure Event Hubs monitoring data reference](monitor-event-hubs-reference.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the Azure Event Hubs menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current workspace. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other databases or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/scope) for details.

### Use runtime logs

Azure Event Hubs allows you to monitor and audit data plane interactions of your client applications using runtime audit logs and application metrics logs. 

Using *Runtime audit logs* you can capture aggregated diagnostic information for all data plane access operations such as publishing or consuming events. *Application metrics logs* capture the aggregated data on certain runtime metrics (such as consumer lag and active connections) related to client applications are connected to Event Hubs.

> [!NOTE] 
> Runtime audit logs are available only in **premium** and **dedicated** tiers.  

### Enable runtime logs

You can enable either runtime audit or application metrics logging by selecting *Diagnostic settings* from the *Monitoring* section on the Event Hubs namespace page in Azure portal. Select **Add diagnostic setting** as shown in the following image.  

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-event-hubs/add-diagnostic-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Diagnostic settings page for an Event Hubs namespace." lightbox="./media/monitor-event-hubs/add-diagnostic-settings.png":::

Then you can enable log categories *RuntimeAuditLogs* or *ApplicationMetricsLogs* as needed.  

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-event-hubs/configure-diagnostic-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the runtime audit and application metric logs enabled." lightbox="./media/monitor-event-hubs/configure-diagnostic-settings.png":::

Once runtime logs are enabled, Event Hubs start collecting and storing them according to the diagnostic setting configuration.

### Publish and consume sample data

To collect sample runtime audit logs in your Event Hubs namespace, you can publish and consume sample data using client applications that are based on the [Event Hubs SDK](../event-hubs/event-hubs-dotnet-standard-getstarted-send.md). That SDK uses Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). Or you can use any [Apache Kafka client application](../event-hubs/event-hubs-quickstart-kafka-enabled-event-hubs.md).

Application metrics include the following runtime metrics.

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-event-hubs/application-metrics-logs.png" alt-text="Image showing the result of a sample query to analyze application metrics." lightbox="./media/monitor-event-hubs/application-metrics-logs.png":::

Therefore you can use application metrics to monitor runtime metrics such as consumer lag or active connection from a given client application. Fields associated with runtime audit logs are defined in [application metrics logs reference](../event-hubs/monitor-event-hubs-reference.md#runtime-audit-logs).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]

### Sample Kusto queries

Following are sample queries that you can use to help you monitor your Azure Event Hubs resources:

### [AzureDiagnostics](#tab/AzureDiagnostics)

- Get errors from the past seven days.

  ```Kusto
  AzureDiagnostics
  | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
  | where ResourceProvider =="MICROSOFT.EVENTHUB"
  | where Category == "OperationalLogs"
  | summarize count() by "EventName"

- Get runtime audit logs generated in the last one hour.

  ```Kusto
  AzureDiagnostics
  | where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
  | where ResourceProvider =="MICROSOFT.EVENTHUB"
  | where Category == "RuntimeAuditLogs"    
  ```

- Get access attempts to a key vault that resulted in "key not found" error.

  ```Kusto
  AzureDiagnostics
  | where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.EVENTHUB" 
  | where Category == "Error" and OperationName == "wrapkey"
  | project Message
  ```

- Get operations performed with a key vault to disable or restore the key.

  ```Kusto
  AzureDiagnostics
  | where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.EVENTHUB"
  | where Category == "info" and OperationName == "disable" or OperationName == "restore"
  | project Message
  ```

- Get capture failures and their duration in seconds.

  ```kusto
  AzureDiagnostics
  | where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.EVENTHUB"
  | where Category == "ArchiveLogs"
  | summarize count() by "failures", "durationInSeconds"    
  ```

### [Resource Specific Table](#tab/Resourcespecifictable)

- Get Operational Logs for event hub resource for last seven days.

  ```Kusto
  AZMSOperationalLogs 
  | where Timegenerated > ago(7d) 
  | where Provider == "EVENTHUB"
  | where resourceId == "<Resource Id>" // Replace your resource Id
  ```

- Get capture logs for event hub for last seven days.

  ```Kusto
  AZMSArchiveLogs
  | where EventhubName == "<Event Hub Name>" //Enter event hub entity name
  | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
  ```

---

### Analyze runtime audit logs

You can analyze the collected runtime audit logs using the following sample query.

### [AzureDiagnostics](#tab/AzureDiagnosticsforRuntimeAudit)

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.EVENTHUB"
| where Category == "RuntimeAuditLogs"
```

### [Resource Specific Table](#tab/ResourcespecifictableforRuntimeAudit)

```kusto
AZMSRuntimeAuditLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where Provider == "EVENTHUB"
```

---

Up on the execution of the query you should be able to obtain corresponding audit logs in the following format.

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-event-hubs/runtime-audit-logs.png" alt-text="Image showing the result of a sample query to analyze runtime audit logs." lightbox="./media/monitor-event-hubs/runtime-audit-logs.png":::

By analyzing these logs, you should be able to audit how each client application interacts with Event Hubs. Each field associated with runtime audit logs is defined in [runtime audit logs reference](../event-hubs/monitor-event-hubs-reference.md#runtime-audit-logs).

### Analyze application metrics

You can analyze the collected application metrics logs using the following sample query.

### [AzureDiagnostics](#tab/AzureDiagnosticsforAppMetrics)
