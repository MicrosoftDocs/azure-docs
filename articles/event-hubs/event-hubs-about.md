# What is Azure Event Hubs?

Azure Event Hubs is a fully managed, real-time data streaming platform that can ingest millions of events per second with low latency. As a native Azure service with built-in Apache Kafka compatibility, Event Hubs enables you to run existing Kafka workloads without code changes or cluster management overhead.

Organizations use Event Hubs to build data pipelines for IoT telemetry, application logging, clickstream analytics, financial transaction processing, and other scenarios that require high-throughput, reliable event ingestion. Event Hubs integrates with Azure analytics services to enable real-time insights and long-term data retention.

## When to use Event Hubs

Event Hubs is designed for high-throughput, low-latency event streaming scenarios. Consider Event Hubs when you need to:

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Real-time analytics** | Process streaming data to generate immediate insights, dashboards, and alerts |
| **IoT telemetry ingestion** | Collect device data from millions of IoT sensors, vehicles, or industrial equipment |
| **Application logging** | Centralize logs from distributed applications for monitoring and troubleshooting |
| **Clickstream analytics** | Analyze user behavior patterns across web and mobile applications |
| **Financial transactions** | Process high-volume trading data, fraud detection signals, and payment events |
| **Event sourcing** | Implement event-driven architectures with durable, ordered event storage |

### Choosing between Azure messaging services

Azure offers multiple messaging services. Use this guidance to select the right service:

| Service | Best for | Message pattern |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Event Hubs** | High-throughput event streaming, telemetry, log aggregation | Many producers, multiple consumers, time-ordered events |
| **Service Bus** | Enterprise messaging with transactions, sessions, dead-lettering | Point-to-point or pub/sub with delivery guarantees |
| **Event Grid** | Reactive event-driven architectures, serverless triggers | Push-based event routing with filtering |

For detailed guidance, see [Choose between Azure messaging services](../service-bus-messaging/compare-messaging-services.md).

## How it works

Event Hubs provides a unified streaming platform with time-based retention, decoupling event producers from consumers. Both can perform large-scale data ingestion and processing through multiple protocols.

:::image type="content" source="./media/event-hubs-about/components.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the main components of Event Hubs.":::

### Core components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Producer applications** | Applications that send events to Event Hubs using [Event Hubs SDKs](sdks.md), Kafka producer clients, or HTTPS |
| **Namespace** | Management container for one or more event hubs. Handles [streaming capacity](event-hubs-scalability.md), [network security](network-security.md), and [geo-disaster recovery](event-hubs-geo-dr.md) at the namespace level |
| **Event hub / Kafka topic** | An append-only distributed log that organizes events. Contains one or more [partitions](event-hubs-features.md#partitions) for parallel processing |
| **Partitions** | Ordered sequences of events used to scale throughput. Think of partitions as lanes on a freeway—more partitions enable higher throughput |
| **Consumer applications** | Applications that read events by tracking their position (offset) in each partition. Can use [Event Hubs SDKs](sdks.md) or Kafka consumer clients |
| **Consumer group** | A logical view of the event hub that enables multiple consumer applications to read the same stream independently, each maintaining its own position |

### Event flow

1. **Ingest**: Producer applications send events to an event hub. Events are assigned to partitions based on partition key or round-robin distribution.
2. **Store**: Events are durably stored with configurable retention (1-90 days depending on tier). The [Capture](event-hubs-capture-overview.md) feature can also write events to long-term storage.
3. **Process**: Consumer applications read events from partitions using consumer groups. Each consumer tracks its offset using [checkpointing](event-hubs-features.md#checkpointing) for reliable processing.

For a detailed explanation, see [Event Hubs features](event-hubs-features.md).

## Key capabilities

### Core platform features

#### Apache Kafka compatibility

Event Hubs is a multi-protocol event streaming engine that natively supports Apache Kafka, AMQP 1.0, and HTTPS. You can bring Kafka workloads to Event Hubs without code changes, cluster management, or third-party Kafka services.

Event Hubs is built as a cloud-native broker engine, delivering better performance and cost efficiency than self-managed Kafka clusters. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs for Apache Kafka](azure-event-hubs-apache-kafka-overview.md).

#### Flexible scaling

Start with data streams in megabytes and grow to gigabytes or terabytes. The [auto-inflate](event-hubs-auto-inflate.md) feature automatically scales throughput units to meet demand. For predictable high-volume workloads, [dedicated clusters](event-hubs-dedicated-overview.md) provide reserved capacity.

#### Large message support (preview)

While most streaming scenarios involve lightweight messages under 1 MB, Event Hubs accommodates events up to 20 MB with [dedicated clusters](event-hubs-dedicated-overview.md). For more information, see [Send and receive large messages](event-hubs-quickstart-stream-large-messages.md).

### Data management

#### Schema Registry

[Azure Schema Registry](schema-registry-overview.md) provides a centralized repository for managing schemas of event streaming applications. It ensures data compatibility and consistency across producers and consumers, supports schema evolution, and integrates with Kafka applications using Avro and JSON schemas.
