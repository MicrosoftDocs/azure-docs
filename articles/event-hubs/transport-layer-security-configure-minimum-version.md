# Configure the minimum TLS version for an Event Hubs namespace

Azure Event Hubs namespaces permit clients to send and receive data with TLS 1.0 and above. To enforce stricter security measures, you can configure your Event Hubs namespace to require that clients send and receive data with a newer version of TLS. If an Event Hubs namespace requires a minimum version of TLS, then any requests made with an older version will fail. For conceptual information about this feature, see [Enforce a minimum required version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for requests to an Event Hubs namespace](transport-layer-security-enforce-minimum-version.md).

You can configure the minimum TLS version using the Azure portal or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. 

## Specify the minimum TLS version in the Azure portal
You can specify the minimum TLS version when creating an Event Hubs namespace in the Azure portal on the **Advanced** tab.

You can also specify the minimum TLS version for an existing namespace on the **Configuration** page.

## Create a template to configure the minimum TLS version

To configure the minimum TLS version for an Event Hubs namespace with a template, create a template with the  `MinimumTlsVersion`  property set to 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2. When you create an Event Hubs namespace with an Azure Resource Manager template, the `MinimumTlsVersion` property is set to 1.2 by default, unless explicitly set to another version.

> [!NOTE]
> Namespaces created using an api-version prior to 2022-01-01-preview will have 1.0 as the value for `MinimumTlsVersion`. This behavior was the prior default, and is still there for backwards compatibility.

The following steps describe how to create a template in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, choose  **Create a resource**.
2. In  **Search the Marketplace** , type  **custom deployment** , and then press  **ENTER**.
3. Choose **Custom deployment (deploy using custom templates) (preview)**, choose  **Create** , and then choose  **Build your own template in the editor**.
4. In the template editor, paste in the following JSON to create a new namespace and set the minimum TLS version to TLS 1.2. Remember to replace the placeholders in angle brackets with your own values.

    ```json
    {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "parameters": {},
        "variables": {
            "eventHubNamespaceName": "[concat(uniqueString(subscription().subscriptionId), 'tls')]"
        },
        "resources": [
            {
            "name": "[variables('eventHubNamespaceName')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces",
            "apiVersion": "2022-01-01-preview",
            "location": "westeurope",
            "properties": {
                "minimumTlsVersion": "1.2"
            },
            "dependsOn": [],
            "tags": {}
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

5. Save the template.
6. Specify resource group parameter, then choose the  **Review + create**  button to deploy the template and create a namespace with the  `MinimumTlsVersion`  property configured.

> [!NOTE]
> After you update the minimum TLS version for the Event Hubs namespace, it may take up to 30 seconds before the change is fully propagated.

Configuring the minimum TLS version requires api-version 2022-01-01-preview or later of the Azure Event Hubs resource provider.

## Check the minimum required TLS version for a namespace

To check the minimum required TLS version for your Event Hubs namespace, you can query the Azure Resource Manager API. You'll need a Bearer token to query against the API, which you can retrieve using the [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient) app by executing the following commands.

```powershell
.\ARMClient.exe login
.\ARMClient.exe token <your-subscription-id>
```

Once you have your bearer token, you can use the script below in combination with something like [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) to query the API.

```http
@token = Bearer <Token received from ARMClient>
@subscription = <your-subscription-id>
@resourceGroup = <your-resource-group-name>
@namespaceName = <your-namespace-name>

###
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{{subscription}}/resourceGroups/{{resourceGroup}}/providers/Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/{{namespaceName}}?api-version=2022-01-01-preview
content-type: application/json
Authorization: {{token}}
```

The response should look something like the below, with the minimumTlsVersion set under the properties.

```json
{
  "sku": {
    "name": "Premium",
    "tier": "Premium",
    "capacity": 1
  },
  "id": "/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<your-resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/<your-namespace-name>",
  "name": "<your-namespace-name>",
  "type": "Microsoft.EventHub/Namespaces",
  "location": "West Europe",
  "properties": {
    "minimumTlsVersion": "1.2",
    "publicNetworkAccess": "Enabled",
    "disableLocalAuth": false,
    "zoneRedundant": true,
    "isAutoInflateEnabled": false,
    "maximumThroughputUnits": 0,
    "kafkaEnabled": true,
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "status": "Active"
  }
}
```

## Test the minimum TLS version from a client

To test that the minimum required TLS version for an Event Hubs namespace forbids calls made with an older version, you can configure a client to use an older version of TLS. For more information about configuring a client to use a specific version of TLS, see [Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) for a client application](transport-layer-security-configure-client-version.md).

When a client accesses an Event Hubs namespace using a TLS version that doesn't meet the minimum TLS version configured for the namespace, Azure Event Hubs returns error code 401 (Unauthorized) and a message indicating that the TLS version that was used isn't permitted for making requests against this Event Hubs namespace.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to limitations in the confluent library, errors coming from an invalid TLS version will not surface when connecting through the Kafka protocol. Instead a general exception will be shown.

> [!NOTE]
> When you configure a minimum TLS version for an Event Hubs namespace, that minimum version is enforced at the application layer. Tools that attempt to determine TLS support at the protocol layer may return TLS versions in addition to the minimum required version when run directly against the Event Hubs namespace endpoint.
