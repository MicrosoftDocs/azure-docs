# Get started with Event Hubs

[AZURE.INCLUDE [service-bus-selector-get-started](../../includes/service-bus-selector-get-started.md)]

## Introduction

Event Hubs is a highly scalable ingestion system that can intake millions of events per second, enabling an application to process and analyze the massive amounts of data produced by your connected devices and applications. Once collected into Event Hubs, you can transform and store data using any real-time analytics provider or storage cluster.

For more information, please see the [Event Hubs overview].

In this tutorial, you will learn how to ingest messages into an Event Hub using a console application in C#, and to retrieve them in parallel using Apache Storm.

In order to complete this tutorial you will need the following:

+ [Microsoft Visual Studio](http://visualstudio.com)

+ A Java development environment configured to run [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). For this tutorial, we will assume [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)

+ An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an account, you can create a free account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started%2F" target="_blank">Azure Free Trial</a>.

## Run the applications

Now you are ready to run the applications.

1.	Run the **LogTopology** class from Eclipse, then wait for it to start the receivers for all the partitions.

2.	Run the **Sender** project, press **Enter** in the console window, and see the events appear in the receiver window.

## Next steps

Now that you've built a working application that creates an Event Hub and sends and receives data, you can move on to the following scenarios:

- A complete [sample application that uses Event Hubs][].
- The [Scale out Event Processing with Event Hubs][] sample.
- A [queued messaging solution][] using Service Bus queues.
