# View Azure Spring Cloud Enterprise Tier offering in Azure Marketplace

**This article applies to:** ❌ Basic/Standard tier ✔️ Enterprise tier

This article shows you how to view the Azure Spring Cloud Enterprise Tier with VMware Tanzu offering through Azure Marketplace and how to redirect to the Azure Spring Cloud Enterprise tier creation page from Azure Marketplace.

Azure Spring Cloud Enterprise Tier is optimized for the needs of enterprise Spring developers through advanced configurability, flexibility, portability, and enterprise-ready VMware Spring Runtime 24x7 support. Developers also benefit from commercial Tanzu components, such as VMware Tanzu® Build Service™, Application Configuration Service for VMware Tanzu®, and VMware Tanzu® Service Registry, and access to Spring experts.

You can obtain and pay for a license to Tanzu components through an [Azure Marketplace offering](https://aka.ms/ascmpoffer). Azure Spring Cloud manages the license acquisition so you won't have to do it yourself.

## Prerequisites

To purchase in the Azure Marketplace, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- Your Azure subscription is registered to the `Microsoft.SaaS` resource provider. See how to [register a resource provider](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#register-resource-provider).
- Your Azure subscription has an [associated payment method](/marketplace/azure-marketplace-overview#purchasing-requirements). Azure credits or free MSDN subscriptions aren't supported.
- Your Azure subscription belongs to a billing account in a [Marketplace supported geographic location](../marketplace/marketplace-geo-availability-currencies.md#supported-geographic-locations).
- Your organization allows [Azure Marketplace purchases](../cost-management-billing/manage/ea-azure-marketplace.md#enabling-azure-marketplace-purchases).
- Your organization allows acquiring any Azure Marketplace software application listed in [Purchase policy management](/marketplace/azure-purchasing-invoicing#purchase-policy-management).
