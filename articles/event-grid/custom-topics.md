# Custom topics in Azure Event Grid

An Event Grid topic provides an endpoint where the source sends events. The publisher creates an Event Grid topic, and decides whether an event source needs one topic or more than one topic. A topic is used for a collection of related events. To respond to certain types of events, subscribers decide which topics to subscribe to.

**Custom topics** are application and third-party topics. When you create or are given access to a custom topic, you see that custom topic in your subscription. Custom topics support [push delivery](push-delivery-overview.md). Consult [when to use pull or push delivery](pull-delivery-overview.md#when-to-use-push-delivery-vs-pull-delivery) to help you decide if push delivery is the right approach given your requirements.

When designing your application, you have to decide how many topics to create. For relatively large solutions, create a **custom topic** for **each category of related events**. For example, consider an application that manages user accounts and another application about customer orders. It's unlikely that all event subscribers want events from both applications. To segregate concerns, create two topics: one for each application. Let event handlers subscribe to the topic according to their requirements. For small solutions, you might prefer to send all events to a single topic. Event subscribers can filter for the event types they want.

## Event schema

Custom topics supports two types of event schemas: Cloud events and Event Grid schema.

### Cloud event schema

In addition to its [default event schema](event-schema.md), Azure Event Grid natively supports events in the [JSON implementation of CloudEvents v1.0](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/json-format.md) and [HTTP protocol binding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/http-protocol-binding.md). [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) is an [open specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md) for describing event data.

CloudEvents simplifies interoperability by providing a common event schema for publishing and consuming events. This schema allows for uniform tooling, standard ways of routing & handling events, and a common way to deserialize your events. With a common schema, you can more easily integrate work across platforms.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see [Cloud event schema](cloud-event-schema.md).

### Event Grid event schema

When you use Event Grid event schema, you can specify your application-specific properties in the **data** object. 

```json
[
  {
    "topic": string,
    "subject": string,
    "id": string,
    "eventType": string,
    "eventTime": string,
    "data":{
      object-unique-to-each-publisher
    },
    "dataVersion": string,
    "metadataVersion": string
  }
]
```

> For more information, see [Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md).

The following sections provide links to tutorials to create custom topics using Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

## Azure portal tutorials
The following quickstarts or tutorials show you how to create a topic, send evens to the topic's endpoint, and route them to supported destinations by using the Azure portal.
