## View custom topic metrics

If you've published a custom topic, you can view the metrics for it. 

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the search bar at the topic, type **Event Grid Topics**, and then select **Event Grid Topics** from the drop-down list.

3. Select your custom topic from the list of topics. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-event-delivery/select-custom-topic.png" alt-text="Select your custom topic":::
4. View the metrics for the custom event topic on the **Event Grid Topic** page. In the following image, the **Essentials** section that shows the resource group, subscription etc. is minimized.

    You can create charts with supported metrics by using the **Metrics** tab of the **Event Grid Topic** page.

    For example, see the metrics chart for the **Published Events** metric.

## View subscription metrics
1. Navigate to the **Event Grid Topic** page by following steps from the previous section. 
2. Select the subscription from the bottom pane as shown in the following example.

    You can also search for **Event Grid Subscriptions** in the search bar in the Azure portal, select **Topic Type**, **Subscription**, and **Location** to see an event subscription. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-event-delivery/event-subscriptions-page.png" alt-text="Select event subscription from Event Grid Subscriptions page":::        

    For custom topics, select **Event Grid Topics** as **Topic Type**. For system topics, select the type of the Azure resource, for example, **Storage Accounts (Blob, GPv2)**. 
3. See the metrics for the subscription on the home page for the subscription in a chart. You can see **General**, **Error**, and **Latency** metrics for past 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 7 days, or 30 days.
