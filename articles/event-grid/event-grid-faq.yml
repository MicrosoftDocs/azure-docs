      - question: |
          Is Azure Event Grid high available?
        answer: |
          Azure Event Grid it's automatically replicated in three availability zones when available to provide automatic in-region recovery of your data if a failure occurs in the region. See [Azure regions with availability zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md#azure-regions-with-availability-zones) to learn more about the supported regions with availability zones. 
          
      - question: |
          How do I recover from a failover?
        answer: |
          If you opt in "within a region and geo-pair" in data residency configuration of the Azure Event Grid topics and domains, event subscription configuration data, aka "metadata" will be replicated to a predefined secondary region. This allows Microsoft-initiated fail over to the paired region in case of a region failure. See [Azure cross-region replication pairings for all geographies](../availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure.md#azure-cross-region-replication-pairings-for-all-geographies) to learn more about the supported paired regions. Otherwise, if you opt in "within a region", no data of any kind is replicated to another region by Microsoft. You may define your own disaster recovery plan. For more information, see [Build your own disaster recovery for custom topics in Event Grid](custom-disaster-recovery.md)..
          Microsoft-initiated failover is exercised by Microsoft in rare situations to failover Event Grid resources from an affected region to the corresponding geo-paired region. This process doesn’t require an intervention from the user. Microsoft reserves the right to make a determination of when this option will be exercised. This mechanism doesn't involve a user consent before the user's topic is failed over.

      - question: |
          Where does Azure Event Grid store data?
        answer: |
          Azure Event Grid stores and processes data published in the region that you select when you create topics and domains resources. By default, customer data stays within the selected region. For all regions except Brazil South and Southeast Asia, the database backup is hosted in a different region (usually the Azure paired region). For the Brazil south and Southeast Asia regions, database backups are stored in the same region to accommodate data-residency requirements for these regions.
