2. [Authorize partner](#authorize-partner-to-create-a-partner-topic) to create a partner topic in your resource group.
3. [Request partner to enable events flow to a partner topic](#request-partner-to-enable-events-flow-to-a-partner-topic).
4. [Activate partner topic](#activate-a-partner-topic) so that your events start flowing to your partner topic.
