# Azure Communication Services - SMS events

This article provides the properties and schema for communication services SMS events.Â For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md).

## Events types

Azure Communication Services emits the following SMS event types:

| Event type                                                  | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft.Communication.SMSReceived                         | Published when an SMS is received by a phone number associated with the Communication Service. |
| Microsoft.Communication.SMSDeliveryReportReceived           | Published when a delivery report is received for an SMS sent by the Communication Service.     |

## Event responses

When an event is triggered, the Event Grid service sends data about that event to subscribing endpoints.

This section contains an example of what that data would look like for each event.
