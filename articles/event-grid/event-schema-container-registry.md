# Azure Event Grid event schema for Container Registry

This article provides the properties and schema for Container Registry events. For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md).

## Available event types

Azure Container Registry emits the following event types:

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ImagePushed | Raised when an image is pushed. |
| Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ImageDeleted | Raised when an image is deleted. |
| Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ChartPushed | Raised when a Helm chart is pushed. |
| Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ChartDeleted | Raised when a Helm chart is deleted. |

## Example event

The following example shows the schema of an image pushed event: 

```json
[{
  "id": "831e1650-001e-001b-66ab-eeb76e069631",
  "topic": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<name>",
  "subject": "aci-helloworld:v1",
  "eventType": "ImagePushed",
  "eventTime": "2018-04-25T21:39:47.6549614Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "31c51664-e5bd-416a-a5df-e5206bc47ed0",
    "timestamp": "2018-04-25T21:39:47.276585742Z",
    "action": "push",
    "target": {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
      "size": 3023,
      "digest": "sha256:213bbc182920ab41e18edc2001e06abcca6735d87782d9cef68abd83941cf0e5",
      "length": 3023,
      "repository": "aci-helloworld",
      "tag": "v1"
    },
    "request": {
      "id": "7c66f28b-de19-40a4-821c-6f5f6c0003a4",
      "host": "demo.azurecr.io",
      "method": "PUT",
      "useragent": "docker/18.03.0-ce go/go1.9.4 git-commit/0520e24 os/windows arch/amd64 UpstreamClient(Docker-Client/18.03.0-ce \\\\(windows\\\\))"
    }
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```

The schema for an image deleted event is similar:

```json
[{
  "id": "f06e3921-301f-42ec-b368-212f7d5354bd",
  "topic": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<name>",
  "subject": "aci-helloworld",
  "eventType": "ImageDeleted",
  "eventTime": "2018-04-26T17:56:01.8211268Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "f06e3921-301f-42ec-b368-212f7d5354bd",
    "timestamp": "2018-04-26T17:56:00.996603117Z",
    "action": "delete",
    "target": {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
      "digest": "sha256:213bbc182920ab41e18edc2001e06abcca6735d87782d9cef68abd83941cf0e5",
      "repository": "aci-helloworld"
    },
    "request": {
      "id": "aeda5b99-4197-409f-b8a8-ff539edb7de2",
      "host": "demo.azurecr.io",
      "method": "DELETE",
      "useragent": "python-requests/2.18.4"
    }
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```

The schema for a chart pushed event is similar to the schema for an imaged pushed event, but it doesn't include a request object:

```json
[{
  "id": "ea3a9c28-5b17-40f6-a500-3f02b6829277",
  "topic": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<name>",
  "subject": "mychart:1.0.0",
  "eventType": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ChartPushed",
  "eventTime": "2019-03-12T22:16:31.5164086Z",
  "data": {
    "id":"ea3a9c28-5b17-40f6-a500-3f02b682927",
    "timestamp":"2019-03-12T22:16:31.0087496+00:00",
    "action":"chart_push",
    "target":{
      "mediaType":"application/vnd.acr.helm.chart",
      "size":25265,
      "digest":"sha256:7f060075264b5ba7c14c23672698152ae6a3ebac1c47916e4efe19cd624d5fab",
      "repository":"repo",
      "tag":"mychart-1.0.0.tgz",
      "name":"mychart",
      "version":"1.0.0"
    }
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```

The schema for a chart deleted event is similar to the schema for an imaged deleted event, but it doesn't include a request object:

```json
[{
  "id": "39136b3a-1a7e-416f-a09e-5c85d5402fca",
  "topic": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<name>",
  "subject": "mychart:1.0.0",
  "eventType": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ChartDeleted",
  "eventTime": "019-03-12T22:42:08.7034064Z",
  "data": {
    "id":"ea3a9c28-5b17-40f6-a500-3f02b682927",
    "timestamp":"2019-03-12T22:42:08.3783775+00:00",
    "action":"chart_delete",
    "target":{
      "mediaType":"application/vnd.acr.helm.chart",
      "size":25265,
      "digest":"sha256:7f060075264b5ba7c14c23672698152ae6a3ebac1c47916e4efe19cd624d5fab",
      "repository":"repo",
      "tag":"mychart-1.0.0.tgz",
      "name":"mychart",
      "version":"1.0.0"
    }
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```
