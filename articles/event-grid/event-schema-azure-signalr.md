# Azure SignalR as an Azure Event Grid source

This article provides the properties and schema for SignalR Service events.Â For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). It also gives you a list of quick starts and tutorials to use Azure SignalR as an event source.


## Available event types

SignalR Service emits the following event types:

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionConnected | Raised when a client connection connected. |
| Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionDisconnected | Raised when a client connection disconnected. |

## Example event


# [Cloud event schema](#tab/cloud-event-schema)

The following example shows the schema of a client connection connected event: 

```json
[{
  "source": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/signalr-rg/providers/Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/signalr-resource",
  "subject": "/hub/chat",
  "type": "Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionConnected",
  "time": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
  "id": "831e1650-001e-001b-66ab-eeb76e069631",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
    "hubName": "chat",
    "connectionId": "crH0uxVSvP61p5wkFY1x1A",
    "userId": "user-eymwyo23"
  },
  "specversion": "1.0"
}]
```

The schema for a client connection disconnected event is similar: 

```json
[{
  "source": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/signalr-rg/providers/Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/signalr-resource",
  "subject": "/hub/chat",
  "type": "Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionDisconnected",
  "time": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
  "id": "831e1650-001e-001b-66ab-eeb76e069631",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
    "hubName": "chat",
    "connectionId": "crH0uxVSvP61p5wkFY1x1A",
    "userId": "user-eymwyo23",
    "errorMessage": "Internal server error."
  },
  "specversion": "1.0"
}]
```

# [Event Grid event schema](#tab/event-grid-event-schema)
The following example shows the schema of a client connection connected event: 

```json
[{
  "topic": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/signalr-rg/providers/Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/signalr-resource",
  "subject": "/hub/chat",
  "eventType": "Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionConnected",
  "eventTime": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
  "id": "831e1650-001e-001b-66ab-eeb76e069631",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
    "hubName": "chat",
    "connectionId": "crH0uxVSvP61p5wkFY1x1A",
    "userId": "user-eymwyo23"
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```

The schema for a client connection disconnected event is similar: 

```json
[{
  "topic": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/signalr-rg/providers/Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/signalr-resource",
  "subject": "/hub/chat",
  "eventType": "Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionDisconnected",
  "eventTime": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
  "id": "831e1650-001e-001b-66ab-eeb76e069631",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
    "hubName": "chat",
    "connectionId": "crH0uxVSvP61p5wkFY1x1A",
    "userId": "user-eymwyo23",
    "errorMessage": "Internal server error."
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```

An event has the following top-level data:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `source` | string | Full resource path to the event source. This field isn't writeable. Event Grid provides this value. |
| `subject` | string | Publisher-defined path to the event subject. |
| `type` | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. |
| `time` | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| `data` | object | SignalR Service event data. |
| `specversion` | string | CloudEvents schema specification version. |

# [Event Grid event schema](#tab/event-grid-event-schema)
An event has the following top-level data:

| Property | Type | Description |
