# Azure Event Grid event schema for SignalR Service

This article provides the properties and schema for SignalR Service events. For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md).


## Available event types

SignalR Service emits the following event types:

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionConnected | Raised when a client connection connected. |
| Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionDisconnected | Raised when a client connection disconnected. |

## Example event

The following example shows the schema of a client connection connected event: 

```json
[{
  "topic": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/signalr-rg/providers/Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/signalr-resource",
  "subject": "/hub/chat",
  "eventType": "Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionConnected",
  "eventTime": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
  "id": "831e1650-001e-001b-66ab-eeb76e069631",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
    "hubName": "chat",
    "connectionId": "crH0uxVSvP61p5wkFY1x1A",
    "userId": "user-eymwyo23"
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```

The schema for a client connection disconnected event is similar: 

```json
[{
  "topic": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/signalr-rg/providers/Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/signalr-resource",
  "subject": "/hub/chat",
  "eventType": "Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionDisconnected",
  "eventTime": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
  "id": "831e1650-001e-001b-66ab-eeb76e069631",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2019-06-10T18:41:00.9584103Z",
    "hubName": "chat",
    "connectionId": "crH0uxVSvP61p5wkFY1x1A",
    "userId": "user-eymwyo23",
    "errorMessage": "Internal server error."
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```

## Event properties

An event has the following top-level data:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| topic | string | Full resource path to the event source. This field is not writeable. Event Grid provides this value. |
| subject | string | Publisher-defined path to the event subject. |
| eventType | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. |
| eventTime | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| id | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| data | object | SignalR Service event data. |
| dataVersion | string | The schema version of the data object. The publisher defines the schema version. |
| metadataVersion | string | The schema version of the event metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event Grid provides this value. |

The data object has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| timestamp | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| hubName | string | The hub which the client connection belongs to. |
