> [!NOTE]
> The following limits listed in this article are per region.

## Event Grid throttle limits

Event Grid offers a standard tier and basic tier. Event Grid standard tier enables pub-sub using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker functionality and pull-delivery of messages through the Event Grid namespace. Event Grid basic tier enables push delivery using Event Grid custom topics, Event Grid system topics, Event domains, and Event Grid partner topics. See [Choose the right Event Grid tier](../choose-right-tier.md). This article describes the quota and limits for both tiers.

## Event Grid Namespace resource limits

[Azure Event Grid namespaces](../concepts-event-grid-namespaces.md#namespaces) enables MQTT messaging, and HTTP pull delivery.
The following limits apply to namespace resources in Azure Event Grid.

| Limit description                      | Limit |
|----------------------------------------|-------|
| Event Grid namespaces per Azure subscription      | 50    |
| Maximum throughput units per Event Grid namespace | 40    |
| IP Firewall rules per Event Grid namespace        | 16    |

## MQTT limits in Event Grid namespace

The following limits apply to MQTT in Azure Event Grid namespace resource.

> [!NOTE]
> Throughput units (TUs) define the ingress and egress event rate capacity in namespaces. They allow you to control the capacity of your namespace resource for message ingress and egress.
