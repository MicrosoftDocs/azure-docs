## Authorize partner to create a partner topic

You must grant your consent to the partner to create partner topics in a resource group that you designate. This authorization has an expiration time. It's effective for the time period you specify between 1 to 365 days. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For a greater security stance, specify the minimum expiration time that offers the partner enough time to configure your events to flow to Event Grid and to provision your partner topic. Your partner won't be able to create resources (partner topics) in your Azure subscription after the authorization expiration time. 

> [!NOTE]
> Event Grid started enforcing authorization checks to create partner topics around June 30th, 2022.
