# Azure Blob Storage as an Event Grid source

This article provides the properties and schema for blob storage events.Â For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). It also gives you a list of quick starts and tutorials to use Azure Blob Storage as an event source.


>[!NOTE]
> Only storage accounts of kind **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**, **BlockBlobStorage**, and **BlobStorage** support event integration. **Storage (general purpose v1)** does *not* support integration with Event Grid.

## Available event types

## Blob Storage events

These events are triggered when a client creates, replaces, or deletes a blob by calling Blob REST APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> The `$logs` and `$blobchangefeed` containers aren't integrated with Event Grid, so activity in these containers will not generate events. Also, using the dfs endpoint *`(abfss://URI) `* for non-hierarchical namespace enabled accounts will not generate events, but the blob endpoint *`(wasb:// URI)`* will generate events.

 |Event name |Description|
 |----------|-----------|
 | [Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated](#microsoftstorageblobcreated-event) |Triggered when a blob is created or replaced. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `PutBlob`, `PutBlockList`, or `CopyBlob` operations that are available in the Blob REST API **and** when the Block Blob is completely committed. <br>If clients use the `CopyBlob` operation on accounts that have the **hierarchical namespace** feature enabled on them, the `CopyBlob` operation works a little differently. In that case, the **Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated** event is triggered when the `CopyBlob` operation is **initiated** and not when the Block Blob is completely committed.   |
 |[Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted](#microsoftstorageblobdeleted-event) |Triggered when a blob is deleted. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients call the `DeleteBlob` operation that is available in the Blob REST API. |
 | [Microsoft.Storage.BlobTierChanged](#microsoftstorageblobtierchanged-event) |Triggered when the blob access tier is changed. Specifically, when clients call the `Set Blob Tier` operation that is available in the Blob REST API, this event is triggered after the tier change completes. |
| [Microsoft.Storage.AsyncOperationInitiated](#microsoftstorageasyncoperationinitiated-event) |Triggered when an operation involving moving or copying of data from the archive to hot or cool tiers is initiated. Specifically, this event is triggered either when clients call the `Set Blob Tier` API to move a blob from archive tier to hot or cool tier, or when clients call the `Copy Blob` API to copy data from a blob in the archive tier to a blob in the hot or cool tier.|

## Data Lake Storage Gen 2 events

These events are triggered if you enable a hierarchical namespace on the storage account, and clients use Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 REST APIs. For more information bout Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, see [Introduction to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](../storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction.md).

|Event name|Description|
|----------|-----------|
| [Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated](#microsoftstorageblobcreated-event-data-lake-storage-gen2) | Triggered when a blob is created or replaced. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `CreateFile` and `FlushWithClose` operations that are available in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 REST API. |
| [Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted](#microsoftstorageblobdeleted-event-data-lake-storage-gen2) |Triggered when a blob is deleted. <br>Specifically, This event is also triggered when clients call the `DeleteFile` operation that is available in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 REST API. |
| [Microsoft.Storage.BlobRenamed](#microsoftstorageblobrenamed-event-data-lake-storage-gen2) |Triggered when a blob is renamed. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `RenameFile` operation that is available in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 REST API.|
| [Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryCreated](#microsoftstoragedirectorycreated-event-data-lake-storage-gen2) |Triggered when a directory is created. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `CreateDirectory` operation that is available in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 REST API.|
| [Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryRenamed](#microsoftstoragedirectoryrenamed-event-data-lake-storage-gen2) |Triggered when a directory is renamed. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `RenameDirectory` operation that is available in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 REST API.|
| [Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryDeleted](#microsoftstoragedirectorydeleted-event-data-lake-storage-gen2) |Triggered when a directory is deleted. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `DeleteDirectory` operation that is available in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 REST API.|

> [!NOTE]
> For **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**, if you want to ensure that the **Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated** event is triggered only when a Block Blob is completely committed, filter the event for the `FlushWithClose` REST API call. This API call triggers the **Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated** event only after data is fully committed to a Block Blob. To learn how to create a filter, see [Filter events for Event Grid](./how-to-filter-events.md).

### Example events


# [Cloud event schema](#tab/cloud-event-schema)

### Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated event (Data Lake Storage Gen2)

If the blob storage account has a hierarchical namespace, the data looks similar to the previous example with an exception of these changes:

* The `data.api` key is set to the string `CreateFile` or `FlushWithClose`.
* The `contentOffset` key is included in the data set.

> [!NOTE]
> If applications use the `PutBlockList` operation to upload a new blob to the account, the data won't contain these changes.

### Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted event (Data Lake Storage Gen2)

If the blob storage account has a hierarchical namespace, the data looks similar to the previous example with an exception of these changes:


* The `data.api` key is set to the string `DeleteFile`.
* The `url` key contains the path `dfs.core.windows.net`.

> [!NOTE]
> If applications use the `DeleteBlob` operation to delete a blob from the account, the data won't contain these changes.

### Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated event (Data Lake Storage Gen2)

If the blob storage account has a hierarchical namespace, the data looks similar to the Blob Storage example with an exception of these changes:

* The `dataVersion` key is set to a value of `2`.

* The `data.api` key is set to the string `CreateFile` or `FlushWithClose`.

* The `contentOffset` key is included in the data set.

> [!NOTE]
> If applications use the `PutBlockList` operation to upload a new blob to the account, the data won't contain these changes.

## SFTP events

These events are triggered if you enable a hierarchical namespace on the storage account, and clients use SFTP APIs. For more information about SFTP support for Azure Blob Storage, see [SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) in Azure Blob Storage](../storage/blobs/secure-file-transfer-protocol-support.md).

|Event name|Description|
|----------|-----------|
| [Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated](#microsoftstorageblobcreated-event-sftp) |Triggered when a blob is created or overwritten. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `put` operation, which corresponds to the `SftpCreate` and `SftpCommit` APIs. An empty blob is created when the file is opened and the uploaded contents are committed when the file is closed. If the `SFTP Resumable Uploads` preview feature is enabled then some `SftpWrite` events will also be triggered during the upload.|
| [Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted](#microsoftstorageblobdeleted-event-sftp) |Triggered when a blob is deleted. <br>Specifically, this event is also triggered when clients call the `rm` operation, which corresponds to the `SftpRemove` API.|
| [Microsoft.Storage.BlobRenamed](#microsoftstorageblobrenamed-event-sftp) |Triggered when a blob is renamed. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `rename` operation on files, which corresponds to the `SftpRename` API.|
| [Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryCreated](#microsoftstoragedirectorycreated-event-sftp) |Triggered when a directory is created. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `mkdir` operation, which corresponds to the `SftpMakeDir` API.|
| [Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryRenamed](#microsoftstoragedirectoryrenamed-event-sftp) |Triggered when a directory is renamed. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `rename` operation on a directory, which corresponds to the `SftpRename` API.|
| [Microsoft.Storage.DirectoryDeleted](#microsoftstoragedirectorydeleted-event-sftp) |Triggered when a directory is deleted. <br>Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the `rmdir` operation, which corresponds to the `SftpRemoveDir` API.|

### Example events
When an event is triggered, the Event Grid service sends data about that event to subscribing endpoint. This section contains an example of what that data would look like for each blob storage event.


# [Cloud event schema](#tab/cloud-event-schema)

### Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated event (SFTP)

If the blob storage account uses SFTP to create or overwrite a blob, then the data looks similar to the previous example with an exception of these changes:

* The `dataVersion` key is set to a value of `3`.

* The `data.api` key is set to the string `SftpCreate`, `SftpWrite`, or `SftpCommit`.

* The `clientRequestId` key isn't included.

* The `contentType` key is set to `application/octet-stream`.

* The `contentOffset` key is included in the data set.

* The `identity` key is included in the data set. This corresponds to the local user used for SFTP authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> SFTP uploads will generate 2 events. One `SftpCreate` for an initial empty blob created when opening the file and one `SftpCommit` when the file contents are committed at the end of the upload. If the `SFTP Resumable Uploads` preview feature is enabled then some `SftpWrite` events will also be triggered during the upload.

> [!NOTE]
> SFTP uploads will generate 2 events. One `SftpCreate` for an initial empty blob created when opening the file and one `SftpCommit` when the file contents are written. If you want to ensure that the Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated event is triggered only when a Block Blob is completely committed, filter the event for the SftpCommit REST API call.

### Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted event (SFTP)

If the blob storage account uses SFTP to delete a blob, then the data looks similar to the previous example with an exception of these changes:

* The `dataVersion` key is set to a value of `2`.

* The `data.api` key is set to the string `SftpRemove`.

* The `clientRequestId` key isn't included.

* The `contentType` key is set to `application/octet-stream`.

* The `identity` key is included in the data set. This corresponds to the local user used for SFTP authentication.

## Policy-related events

These events are triggered when the actions defined by a policy are performed.

 |Event name |Description|
 |----------|-----------|
 | [Microsoft.Storage.BlobInventoryPolicyCompleted](#microsoftstorageblobinventorypolicycompleted-event) |Triggered when the inventory run completes for a rule that is defined an inventory policy. This event also occurs if the inventory run fails with a user error before it starts to run. For example, an invalid policy, or an error that occurs when a destination container isn't present will trigger the event.   |
 | [Microsoft.Storage.LifecyclePolicyCompleted](#microsoftstoragelifecyclepolicycompleted-event) |Triggered when the actions defined by a lifecycle management policy are performed. |

### Example events
When an event is triggered, the Event Grid service sends data about that event to subscribing endpoint. This section contains an example of what that data would look like for each blob storage event.

## Event properties

# [Cloud event schema](#tab/cloud-event-schema)

An event has the following top-level data:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `source` | string | Full resource path to the event source. This field isn't writeable. Event Grid provides this value. |
| `subject` | string | Publisher-defined path to the event subject. |
| `type` | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. |
| `time` | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| `data` | object | Blob storage event data. |
| `specversion` | string | CloudEvents schema specification version. |

# [Event Grid event schema](#tab/event-grid-event-schema)

An event has the following top-level data:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `topic` | string | Full resource path to the event source. This field isn't writeable. Event Grid provides this value. |
| `subject` | string | Publisher-defined path to the event subject. |
| `eventType` | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. |
| `eventTime` | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| `data` | object | Blob storage event data. |
| `dataVersion` | string | The schema version of the data object. The publisher defines the schema version. |
| `metadataVersion` | string | The schema version of the event metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event Grid provides this value. |


---

The data object has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `api` | string | The operation that triggered the event. |
| `clientRequestId` | string | a client-provided request ID for the storage API operation. This ID can be used to correlate to Azure Storage diagnostic logs using the "client-request-id" field in the logs, and can be provided in client requests using the "x-ms-client-request-id" header. See [Log Format](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-log-format). |
| `requestId` | string | Service-generated request ID for the storage API operation. Can be used to correlate to Azure Storage diagnostic logs using the "request-id-header" field in the logs and is returned from initiating API call in the 'x-ms-request-id' header. See [Log Format](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-log-format). |
| `eTag` | string | The value that you can use to run operations conditionally. |
| `contentType` | string | The content type specified for the blob. |
| `contentLength` | integer | The size of the blob in bytes. |
| `blobType` | string | The type of blob. Valid values are either "BlockBlob" or "PageBlob". |
| `accessTier`     | string    | The target tier of the blob. Appears only for the event BlobTierChanged.                                                                                                                                     |
| `previousTier`   | string    | The source tier of the blob. Appears only for the event BlobTierChanged. If the blob is inferring the tier from the storage account, this field will not appear.                                          |
| `contentOffset` | number | The offset in bytes of a write operation taken at the point where the event-triggering application completed writing to the file. <br>Appears only for events triggered on blob storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace.|
| `destinationUrl` |string | The url of the file that will exist after the operation completes. For example, if a file is renamed, the `destinationUrl` property contains the url of the new file name. <br>Appears only for events triggered on blob storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace.|
| `sourceUrl` |string | The url of the file that exists before the operation is done. For example, if a file is renamed, the `sourceUrl` contains the url of the original file name before the rename operation. <br>Appears only for events triggered on blob storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace. |
| `url` | string | The path to the blob. <br>If the client uses a Blob REST API, then the url has this structure: `<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net\<container-name>\<file-name>`. <br>If the client uses a Data Lake Storage REST API, then the url has this structure: `<storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<file-system-name>/<file-name>`. |
| `recursive` | string | `True` to run the operation on all child directories; otherwise `False`. <br>Appears only for events triggered on blob storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace. |
| `sequencer` | string | An opaque string value representing the logical sequence of events for any particular blob name.  Users can use standard string comparison to understand the relative sequence of two events on the same blob name. |
| `identity` | string | A string value representing the identity associated with the event. For SFTP, this is the local user name.|
| `storageDiagnostics` | object | Diagnostic data occasionally included by the Azure Storage service. When present, should be ignored by event consumers. |
