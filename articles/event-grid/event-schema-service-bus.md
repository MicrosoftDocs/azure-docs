# Azure Service Bus as an Event Grid source

This article provides the properties and schema for Service Bus events.Â For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md).

>[!NOTE]
> Only Premium tier Service Bus namespace supports event integration. Basic and Standard tiers do not support integration with Event Grid.

## Tutorials and how-tos
|Title  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
| [Tutorial: Azure Service Bus to Azure Event Grid integration examples](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-to-event-grid-integration-example.md?toc=%2fazure%2fevent-grid%2ftoc.json) | Event Grid sends messages from Service Bus topic to function app and logic app. |
| [Azure Service Bus to Event Grid integration](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-to-event-grid-integration-concept.md) | Overview of integrating Service Bus with Event Grid. |

> [!NOTE]
> When a failover occurs for a Service Bus namespace that's Geo-DR enabled, the secondary namespace doesn't emit events to Event Grid. You need to manually add the Event Grid subscription for the secondary namespace.
>
> Check the [Service Bus Geo-Replication documentation](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-geo-replication) to understand what happens for a Service Bus namespace that's Geo-Replication enabled.
