# Deliver events securely using managed identities
If you're using Event Grid basic and your requirements call for a secure way to send events using an encrypted channel and a known identity of the sender (in this case, Event Grid) using public IP space, you could deliver events to Event Hubs, Service Bus, or Azure Storage service using an Azure Event Grid custom topic or a domain with system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity. For details about delivering events using managed identity, see [Event delivery using a managed identity](managed-service-identity.md).

Under this configuration, the secured traffic from Event Grid to Event Hubs, Service Bus, or Azure Storage, [stays on the Microsoft backbone](../networking/microsoft-global-network.md#get-the-premium-cloud-network) and a managed identity of Event Grid is used. Configuring your Azure Function or webhook from within your virtual network to use an Event Hubs, Service Bus, or Azure Storage via private link ensures the traffic between those services and your function or webhook stays within your virtual network perimeter.

## Deliver events to Event Hubs using managed identity

> [!NOTE]
> This section applies to both Event Grid basic and standard tiers. 

To deliver events to event hubs in your Event Hubs namespace using managed identity, follow these steps:

1. Enable system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity: [system topics](enable-identity-system-topics.md), [custom topics, and domains](enable-identity-custom-topics-domains.md).  
1. [Add the identity to the **Azure Event Hubs Data Sender** role  on the Event Hubs namespace](../event-hubs/authenticate-managed-identity.md#to-assign-azure-roles-using-the-azure-portal).
1. [Enable the **Allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall** setting on your Event Hubs namespace](../event-hubs/event-hubs-service-endpoints.md#trusted-microsoft-services). 
1. [Configure the event subscription](managed-service-identity.md#create-event-subscriptions-that-use-an-identity) that uses an event hub as an endpoint to use the system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity.

## Deliver events to Service Bus using managed identity

> [!NOTE]
> This section applies to the Event Grid basic tier only. 

To deliver events to Service Bus queues or topics in your Service Bus namespace using managed identity, follow these steps:

1. Enable system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity: [system topics](enable-identity-system-topics.md), [custom topics, and domains](enable-identity-custom-topics-domains.md). 
1. [Add the identity to the **Azure Service Bus Data Sender**](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-managed-service-identity.md#azure-built-in-roles-for-azure-service-bus) role on the Service Bus namespace
1. [Enable the **Allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall** setting on your Service Bus namespace](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-service-endpoints.md#trusted-microsoft-services). 
1. [Configure the event subscription](managed-service-identity.md) that uses a Service Bus queue or topic as an endpoint to use the system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity.

## Deliver events to Storage queues using managed identity

> [!NOTE]
> This section applies to the Event Grid basic tier only. 

To deliver events to Storage queues using managed identity, follow these steps:

1. Enable system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity: [system topics](enable-identity-system-topics.md), [custom topics, and domains](enable-identity-custom-topics-domains.md). 
1. [Add the identity to the **Storage Queue Data Message Sender**](../storage/blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access.md) role on Azure Storage queue.
1. [Configure the event subscription](managed-service-identity.md#create-event-subscriptions-that-use-an-identity) that uses a Storage queue as an endpoint to use the system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity.

## Deliver events to Webhooks using managed identity 

> [!NOTE]
> This section applies to both Event Grid basic and standard tiers. 

To deliver events to a Webhook using managed identity, follow these steps: 

1. Enable system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity: [system topics](enable-identity-system-topics.md),â€¯[custom topics and domains](enable-identity-custom-topics-domains.md), and [namespaces](event-grid-namespace-managed-identity.md). 
1. Create a single tenant or multitenant application to set the audience for the token. 
1. [Configure the event subscription](create-view-manage-event-subscriptions.md) that uses a Webhook as an endpoint to use the system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity. Once you select the type of managed identity, you need to introduce the new application ID and the tenant ID. In the cross-tenant scenario, the application ID must be from an application created in the destination tenant. 

## Firewall and virtual network rules
If there's no firewall or virtual network rules configured for the destination Storage account, Event Hubs namespace, or Service Bus namespace, you can use both user-assigned and system-assigned identities to deliver events. 

If a firewall or virtual network rule is configured for the destination Storage account, Event Hubs namespace, or Service Bus namespace, you can use only the system-assigned managed identity if **Allow Azure services on the trusted service list to access the storage account** is also enabled on the destinations. You can't use user-assigned managed identity whether this option is enabled or not.
