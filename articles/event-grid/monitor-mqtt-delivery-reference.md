# Monitor data reference for Azure Event Grid’s MQTT broker feature (Preview)
This article provides a reference of log and metric data collected to analyze the performance and availability of MQTT broker.



## Metrics

| Metric | Display name | Unit | Aggregation | Description | Dimensions | 
| ------ | ------------ | ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | 
| MQTT.RequestCount | MQTT: RequestCount | Count | Total | The number of MQTT requests. | OperationType, Protocol, Result, Error |
| MQTT.Throughput | MQTT: Throughput | Count | Total | The total bytes published to or delivered by the namespace. This metric includes all the MQTT packets that your MQTT clients send to the MQTT broker, regardless of their success.  | Direction |
| MQTT.ThrottlingEnforcements | MQTT: Throttling Enforcements | Count | Total | The number of times that any request got throttled in the namespace.  | ThrottleType |
| MQTT.SuccessfulPublishedMessages | MQTT: Successful Published Messages | Count | Total | The number of MQTT messages that were published successfully into the namespace. | Protocol, QoS | 
| MQTT.FailedPublishedMessages | MQTT: Failed Published Messages | Count | Total | The number of MQTT messages that failed to be published into the namespace. | Protocol, QoS, Error | 
| MQTT.SuccessfulDeliveredMessages | MQTT: Successful Delivered Messages | Count | Total | The number of messages delivered by the namespace, regardless of the acknowledgments from MQTT clients. There are no failures for this operation. | Protocol, QoS |
| MQTT.SuccessfulSubscriptionOperations | MQTT: Successful Subscription Operations | Count | Total | The number of successful subscription operations (Subscribe, Unsubscribe). This metric is incremented for every topic filter within your subscription request that gets accepted by MQTT broker.  | OperationType, Protocol |
| MQTT.FailedSubscriptionOperations | MQTT: Failed Subscription Operations | Count | Total | The number of failed subscription operations (Subscribe, Unsubscribe). This metric is incremented for every topic filter within your subscription request that gets rejected by MQTT broker. | OperationType, Protocol, Error |
| Mqtt.SuccessfulRoutedMessages | MQTT: Successful Routed Messages | Count | Total | The number of MQTT messages that were routed successfully from the namespace. |  |
| Mqtt.FailedRoutedMessages | MQTT: Failed Routed Messages | Count | Total | The number of MQTT messages that failed to be routed from the namespace. | Error |
| MQTT.Connections | MQTT: Active Connections | Count | Total | The number of active connections in the namespace. The value for this metric is a point-in-time value. Connections that were active immediately after that point-in-time might not be reflected in the metric. | Protocol |
| Mqtt.DroppedSessions | MQTT: Dropped Sessions | Count | Total | The number of dropped sessions in the namespace.  The value for this metric is a point-in-time value. Sessions that were dropped immediately after that point-in-time might not be reflected in the metric. | DropReason |



> [!NOTE]
> Each subscription request increments the MQTT.RequestCount metric, while each topic filter within the subscription request increments the subscription operation metrics. For example, consider a subscription request that is sent with five different topic filters. Three of these topic filters were successfully processed while two of the topic filters failed to be processed. The following list represent the resulting increments to the metrics:
> - MQTT.RequestCount:1
> - MQTT.SuccessfulSubscriptionOperations:3
> - MQTT.FailedSubscriptionOperations:2

## Resource logs

MQTT broker in Azure Event Grid captures diagnostic logs for the following categories:

- [Failed MQTT connections](#failed-mqtt-connections)
- [Successful MQTT connections](#successful-mqtt-connections)
- [MQTT disconnections](#mqtt-disconnections)
