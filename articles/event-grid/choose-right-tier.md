# Choose the right Event Grid tier for your solution

Azure Event Grid has two tiers with different capabilities. This article shares details on both.

## Event Grid standard tier

Azure Event Grid includes the following functionality through Event Grid namespaces:

* A Message Queueing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) pub-sub broker that supports bidirectional communication using MQTT v3.1.1 and v5.0.
* CloudEvents publication using HTTP.
* Pull delivery using HTTP.
* Push delivery to Event Hubs using Advanced Messaging Queueing Protocol (AMQP).

Use this tier if any of the following statements is true:

* You want to publish and consume MQTT messages.
* You want to build a solution to trigger actions based on custom application events in CloudEvents JSON format.
* You want to build applications with flexible consumption patterns, e. g. HTTP pull delivery for multiple consumers or push delivery to Event Hubs.
* You require HTTP communication rates greater than 5 MB/s for ingress and egress using pull delivery or push delivery. Event Grid currently supports up to 40 MB/s for ingress and 80 MB/s for egress for events published to namespace topics (HTTP). MQTT supports a throughput rate of 40 MB/s for publisher and subscriber clients.
* You require CloudEvents retention of up to 7 days.

For more information, see quotas and limits for [namespaces](quotas-limits.md#event-grid-namespace-resource-limits).

## Event Grid basic tier

Event Grid basic tier supports push delivery using custom topics, system topics, partner topics, and domains.

Use this tier if any of these statements is true:

* You want to build a solution to trigger actions based on custom application events, Azure system events, partner events.
* You want to publish events to thousands of topics using Event Grid domains.
* You don't have any future needs to support rates greater than 5 MB/s for ingress or egress.
* You don't require event retention greater than 1 day. For example, an event handler logic is able to be patched in less than 1 day in case a bug in its logic. Otherwise, you don't have concerns with the extra cost and overhead of reading events from a blob dead-letter destination.

For more information, see quotas and limits for [custom topics, system topics and partner topics](quotas-limits.md#custom-topic-system-topic-and-partner-topic-resource-limits) and [domains](quotas-limits.md#domain-resource-limits).

## Basic and standard tiers

The standard tier of Event Grid is focused on providing the following features:

* Higher ingress and egress rates.
* Support for IoT solutions that require the use of bidirectional communication using MQTT.
* Pull delivery for multiple consumers.
* Push delivery to Event Hubs.

The basic tier is focused on providing push delivery support to trigger actions based on events. For a detailed breakdown of which quotas and limits are included in each Event Grid resource, see [Quotas and limits](quotas-limits.md).

| Feature   | Standard  | Basic |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Throughput | High, up to 40 MB/s (ingress) and 80 MB/s (egress) | Low, up to 5 MB/s (ingress and egress) |
| MQTT v5 and v3.1.1 | Yes | |
| Pull delivery | Yes | |
| Publish and subscribe to custom events | Yes | Yes |
| Push delivery to Webhooks  |Yes  | Yes
| Push delivery to Event Hubs | Yes | Yes |
| Push delivery to Azure services (Functions, Service Bus queues and topics, relay hybrid connections, and storage queues) | | Yes  |
| Maximum message retention  | 7 days on namespace topics  | 1 day
| Subscribe to Azure system events | | Yes |
| Subscribe to partner events | | Yes |
| Domain scope subscriptions | | Yes |
| Pull delivery to Fabric Eventstream | Yes | No |
