# Azure Key Vault as Event Grid source

This article provides the properties and schema for events in [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/). For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md) and [Cloud event schema](cloud-event-schema.md).


## Available event types

An Azure Key Vault account generates the following event types:

| Event full name | Event display name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |---|
| Microsoft.KeyVault.CertificateNewVersionCreated | Certificate New Version Created | Triggered when a new certificate or new certificate version is created. |
| Microsoft.KeyVault.CertificateNearExpiry | Certificate Near Expiry | Triggered when the current version of certificate is about to expire. (The event is triggered 30 days before the expiration date.) |
| Microsoft.KeyVault.CertificateExpired | Certificate Expired | Triggered when the current version of a certificate is expired. |
| Microsoft.KeyVault.KeyNewVersionCreated | Key New Version Created | Triggered when a new key or new key version is created. |
| Microsoft.KeyVault.KeyNearExpiry | Key Near Expiry | Triggered when the current version of a key is about to expire. The event time can be configured using [key rotation policy](/azure/key-vault/keys/how-to-configure-key-rotation) |
| Microsoft.KeyVault.KeyExpired | Key Expired | Triggered when the current version of a key is expired. |
| Microsoft.KeyVault.SecretNewVersionCreated | Secret New Version Created | Triggered when a new secret or new secret version is created. |
| Microsoft.KeyVault.SecretNearExpiry | Secret Near Expiry | Triggered when the current version of a secret is about to expire. (The event is triggered  30 days before the expiration date.) |
| Microsoft.KeyVault.SecretExpired | Secret Expired | Triggered when the current version of a secret is expired. |
| Microsoft.KeyVault.VaultAccessPolicyChanged | Vault Access Policy Changed | Triggered when an access policy on Key Vault changed. It includes a scenario when Key Vault permission model is changed to/from Azure role-based access control.   |
