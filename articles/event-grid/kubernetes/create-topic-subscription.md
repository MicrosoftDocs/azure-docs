# Route cloud events to Webhooks with Azure Event Grid on Kubernetes
In this quickstart, you create a topic in Event Grid on Kubernetes, create a subscription for the topic, and then send a sample event to the topic to test the scenario. 

[!INCLUDE [preview-feature-note.md](../includes/preview-feature-note.md)]


## Prerequisites

1. [Connect your Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/quickstart-connect-cluster).
1. [Install Event Grid extension on Kubernetes cluster](install-k8s-extension.md). This extension deploys Event Grid to a Kubernetes cluster. 


## Create a custom location
As an Azure location extension, a custom location lets you use your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster as a target location for deploying resources such as Event Grid topics. A custom location represents a namespace in the cluster and it's the place where topics and event subscriptions are deployed. In this section, you create a custom location. 

1. Declare the following variables to hold values of the Azure Arc cluster, resource group, and custom location names. Copy these statements to an editor, replace the values, and then copy/paste to the bash window.  

    ```azurecli-interactive
    resourcegroupname="<AZURE RESOURCE GROUP NAME>"
    arcclustername="<AZURE ARC CLUSTER NAME>"
    customlocationname="<CUSTOM LOCATION NAME>"
    ```
1. Get the resource ID of the Azure Arc-connected cluster. Update values for the Azure Arc cluster name and resource group parameters before running the command. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    hostresourceid=$(az connectedk8s show -n $arcclustername -g $resourcegroupname --query id -o tsv)    
    ```
1. Get the Event Grid extension resource ID. This step assumes that the name you gave for the Event Grid extension is **eventgrid-ext**. Update Azure Arc cluster and resource group names before running the command. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    clusterextensionid=$(az k8s-extension show --name eventgrid-ext --cluster-type connectedClusters -c $arcclustername -g $resourcegroupname  --query id -o tsv)    
    ```
1. Create a custom location using the two values from the previous step. Update custom location and resource group names before running the command. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az customlocation create -n $customlocationname -g $resourcegroupname --namespace arc --host-resource-id $hostresourceid --cluster-extension-ids $clusterextensionid    
    ```
1. Get the resource ID of the custom location. Update the custom location name before running the command. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    customlocationid=$(az customlocation show -n $customlocationname -g $resourcegroupname --query id -o tsv)    
    ```

    For more information on creating custom locations, see [Create and manage custom locations on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/custom-locations). 

## Create a topic
In this section, you create a topic in the custom location you created in the previous step. Update resource group and Event Grid topic names before running the command. Update the location if you're using a location other than East US. 

1. Declare a variable to hold the topic name. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    topicname="<TOPIC NAME>"
    ```
4. Run the following command to create a topic. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az eventgrid topic create -g $resourcegroupname --name $topicname --kind azurearc --extended-location-name $customlocationid --extended-location-type customlocation --input-schema CloudEventSchemaV1_0 --location $region    
    ```

    For more information about the CLI command, see [`az eventgrid topic create`](/cli/azure/eventgrid/topic#az-eventgrid-topic-create).

## Create a message endpoint

Before you create a subscription for the custom topic, create an endpoint for the event message. Typically, the endpoint takes actions based on the event data. To simplify this quickstart, you deploy a [prebuilt web app](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-event-grid-viewer) that displays the event messages. The deployed solution includes an App Service plan, an App Service web app, and source code from GitHub.

1. In the article page, select **Deploy to Azure** to deploy the solution to your subscription. In the Azure portal, provide values for the parameters.

1. The deployment may take a few minutes to complete. After the deployment has succeeded, view your web app to make sure it's running. In a web browser, navigate to: 
`https://<your-site-name>.azurewebsites.net`

    If the deployment fails, check the error message. It may be because the web site name is already taken. Deploy the template again and choose a different name for the site. 
1. You see the site but no events have been posted to it yet.

## Create a subscription
Subscribers can register for events published to a topic. To receive any event, you need to create an Event Grid subscription for a topic of interest. An event subscription defines the destination to which those events are sent. To learn about all the destinations or handlers supported, see [Event handlers](event-handlers.md).

To create an event subscription with a WebHook (HTTPS endpoint) destination, enter a name for the event subscription, update the name of the web site, and run the following command.

```azurecli-interactive
topicid=$(az eventgrid topic show --name $topicname --resource-group $resourcegroupname --query id -o tsv)
az eventgrid event-subscription create --name <EVENT SUBSCRIPTION NAME> --source-resource-id $topicid --endpoint https://<SITE NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/updates
```


For more information about the CLI command, see [`az eventgrid event-subscription create`](/cli/azure/eventgrid/event-subscription#az-eventgrid-event-subscription-create).

## Send events to the topic
1. Run the following command to get the **endpoint** for the topic: After you copy and paste the command, update the **topic name** and **resource group name** before you run the command. You publish sample events to this topic endpoint. 

    ```azurecli
    az eventgrid topic show --name $topicname -g $resourcegroupname --query "endpoint" --output tsv
    ```
2. Run the following command to get the **key** for the custom topic: After you copy and paste the command, update the **topic name** and **resource group** name before you run the command. It's the primary key of the topic. To get this key from the Azure portal, switch to the **Access keys** tab of the **Event Grid Topic** page. To be able post an event to a custom topic, you need the access key. 

    ```azurecli
    az eventgrid topic key list --name $topicname -g $resourcegroupname --query "key1" --output tsv
    ```
1. Run the following **Curl** command to post the event. Specify the endpoint URL and key from step 1 and 2 before running the command. 

    ```bash
    curl  -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/cloudevents-batch+json" -H "aeg-sas-key: <KEY_FROM_STEP_2>" -g <ENDPOINT_URL_FROM_STEP_1> \
    -d  '[{ 
          "specversion": "1.0",
          "type" : "orderCreated",
          "source": "myCompanyName/us/webCommerceChannel/myOnlineCommerceSiteBrandName",
          "id" : "eventId-n",
          "time" : "2020-12-25T20:54:07+00:00",
          "subject" : "account/acct-123224/order/o-123456",
          "dataSchema" : "1.0",
          "data" : {
             "orderId" : "123",
             "orderType" : "PO",
             "reference" : "https://www.myCompanyName.com/orders/123"
          }
    }]'
    ```
    
    If the topic endpoint URL from step 1 is a private IP address, such as in the case when Event Grid broker's service type is ClusterIP, you can execute **Curl** from within another pod in the cluster to have access to that IP address. For example, you can perform the following steps:

    1. Create a manifest file with the following configuration. You may want to adjust the ``dnsPolicy`` according to your needs. For more information, see [DNS for Services and Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/).
    
        ```yml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
            name: test-pod2
        spec:
            containers:
              - name: nginx
                image: nginx
            hostNetwork: true
            dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet       
        ```
    1. Create the pod.
        ```bash
            kubectl apply -f <name_of_your_yaml_manifest_file>
        ```
    1. Verify that the pod is running.
        ```bash
            kubectl get pod test-pod
        ```
    1. Start a shell session from the container
        ```bash
            kubectl exec --stdin --tty test-pod -- /bin/bash
        ```

    At this point, you have a shell session from a running container in the cluster from which you can execute the **Curl** command described in an earlier step.
