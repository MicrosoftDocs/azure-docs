# Azure Resource Notifications - ContainerService events in Azure Event Grid (Preview)

The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses the Container Service Event Resources system topic to deliver preemptive notifications for scheduled maintenance activities on AKS clusters. This functionality enables the reception of push notifications for essential maintenance tasks across different event stages, including scheduled, initiated, completed, canceled, and failed. Notably, for scheduled stage, notifications are dispatched 7 days and 24 hours before the actual maintenance activity.


Notifications encompass:
- Maintenance initiated by AKS (for instance, Underlay migration, Konnectivity Tunnel Switch)
- Maintenance initiated by customers (such as Auto upgrade, Node OS upgrade, and weekly release windows)

These forward-looking notifications assist customers by offering the opportunity to better prepare for potential disruptions, ultimately aiming to minimize operational expenses.



This article provides the properties and the schema for Azure Resource Notifications ContainerService events. For an introduction to event schemas in general, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). In addition, you can find samples of generated events and a link to a related article on how to create system topic for this topic type. 

## Event types
ContainerService  offers the following event type for consumption:

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `Microsoft.ResourceNotifications.ContainerServiceEventResources.ScheduledEventEmitted` | provides advance notifications for scheduled maintenance events on AKS clusters. 

## Role-based access control
Currently, these events are exclusively emitted at the Azure subscription scope. It implies that the entity creating the event subscription for this topic type receives notifications throughout this Azure subscription. For security reasons, it's imperative to restrict the ability to create event subscriptions on this topic to principals with read access over the entire Azure subscription. To access data via this system topic, in addition to the generic permissions required by Event Grid, the following Azure Resource Notifications specific permission is necessary: ``.

Microsoft.ResourceNotifications/systemTopics/subscribeToContainerServiceEventResources/action


## Event schemas


# [Cloud event schema](#tab/cloud-event-schema)

Here's the schema:

```json
{
	"id": "string",
	"source": "string",
	"subject": "string",
	"type": "Microsoft.ResourceNotifications.ContainerServiceEventResources.ScheduledEventEmitted",
	"time ": "string in date-time",
	"data": {
		"resourceInfo": {
			"id": "string",

		},
		"operationalInfo": {
			"resourceEventTime": "string in date-time"
		},
		"apiVersion": "string"
	},

| `time` | String <br/> Format: `2022-11-07T18:43:09.2894075Z` | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time |
| `data` | Object | Contains event data specific to the resource provider. For more information, see the next table. |
| `specversion` | String | CloudEvents schema specification version. |
