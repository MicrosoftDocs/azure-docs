# Quickstart: Publish to namespace topics and consume events in Azure Event Grid

In this quickstart, you do pull delivery using the `curl` bash shell command to publish, receive, and acknowledge events. Use Azure CLI commands to create Azure Event Grid resources. This article is suitable for a quick test of the pull delivery functionality.

For sample code that uses the data plane SDKs, see these resources:

- .NET: [Send and receive messages from an Azure Event Grid namespace topic (.NET)](event-grid-dotnet-get-started-pull-delivery.md)
- Java: [Publish events to namespace topics using Java](publish-events-to-namespace-topics-java.md)
- Java: [Receive events using pull delivery with Java](receive-events-from-namespace-topics-java.md)

For more information about the pull delivery model, see [Azure Event Grid namespace concepts](concepts-event-grid-namespaces.md) and [Pull delivery with HTTP](pull-delivery-overview.md) articles.

- This article requires version 2.0.70 or later of the Azure CLI. If you use Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.  

## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command. Use this resource group to contain all resources you create in this article.

The general steps to use Cloud Shell to run commands are:

- Select **Open Cloud Shell** to see an Azure Cloud Shell window on the right pane. 
- Copy the command and paste into the Azure Cloud Shell window.
- Press ENTER to run the command.

1. Declare a variable to hold the name of an Azure resource group. Specify a name for the resource group by replacing `<your-resource-group-name>` with your value. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    resource_group="<your-resource-group-name>"
    ```

1. Create a resource group. You can change the location to any Azure location. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group create --name $resource_group --location eastus
    ```

## Create a namespace

An Event Grid namespace provides a user-defined endpoint to which you post your events. The following example creates a namespace in your resource group using Bash in Azure Cloud Shell. The namespace name must be unique because it's part of a Domain Name System (DNS) entry. A namespace name should meet the following rules:

- It should be between 3-50 characters.
- It should be regionally unique.
- Only allowed characters are: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and -
- It shouldn't start with reserved key word prefixes like `Microsoft`, `System`, or `EventGrid`.
    
1. Declare a variable to hold the name for your Event Grid namespace. Specify a name for the namespace by replacing `<your-namespace-name>` with your value.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   namespace="<your-namespace-name>"
   ```

1. Create a namespace. You might want to change the location where you deploy it.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az eventgrid namespace create --resource-group $resource_group --name $namespace --location eastus
   ```

## Create a namespace topic

Create a topic that holds all events published to the namespace endpoint.

1. Declare a variable to hold the name for your namespace topic. Specify a name for the namespace topic by replacing `<your-topic-name>` with your value.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   topic="<your-topic-name>"
   ```

1. Create your namespace topic:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az eventgrid namespace topic create --resource-group $resource_group --name $topic --namespace-name $namespace
   ```

## Create an event subscription

Create an event subscription setting its delivery mode to *queue*, which supports [pull delivery](pull-delivery-overview.md). For more information on all configuration options, see [Azure Event Grid REST API](/rest/api/eventgrid).

1. Declare a variable to hold the name for an event subscription to your namespace topic. Specify a name for the event subscription by replacing `<your-event-subscription-name>` with your value.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   event_subscription="<your-event-subscription-name>"
   ```

1. Create an event subscription to the namespace topic:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az eventgrid namespace topic event-subscription create --resource-group $resource_group --topic-name $topic --name $event_subscription --namespace-name $namespace --delivery-configuration "{deliveryMode:Queue,queue:{receiveLockDurationInSeconds:300,maxDeliveryCount:4,eventTimeToLive:P1D}}"
   ```

## Send events to your topic

Send a sample event to the namespace topic by following steps in this section. 

### List namespace access keys

1. Get the access keys associated with the namespace you created. You need one of them to authenticate when publishing events. To list your keys, get the full namespace resource ID. Run the following command:

   ```azurecli-interactive 
   namespace_resource_id=$(az eventgrid namespace show --resource-group $resource_group --name $namespace --query "id" --output tsv)
   ```

1. Get the first key from the namespace:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   key=$(az eventgrid namespace list-key --resource-group $resource_group --namespace-name $namespace --query "key1" --output tsv)
   ```

### Publish an event

1. Retrieve the namespace hostname. You use it to compose the namespace HTTP endpoint to which events are sent. The following operations were first available with API version `2023-06-01-preview`.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   publish_operation_uri="https://"$(az eventgrid namespace show -g $resource_group -n $namespace --query "topicsConfiguration.hostname" --output tsv)"/topics/"$topic:publish?api-version=2023-06-01-preview
   ```

1. Create a sample [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md) compliant event:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   event=' { "specversion": "1.0", "id": "'"$RANDOM"'", "type": "com.yourcompany.order.ordercreatedV2", "source" : "/mycontext", "subject": "orders/O-234595", "time": "'`date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`'", "datacontenttype" : "application/json", "data":{ "orderId": "O-234595", "url": "https://yourcompany.com/orders/o-234595"}} '
   ```

   The `data` element is the payload of your event. Any well-formed JSON can go in this field. Properties that can go into an event are also known as *context attributes*. For more information, see [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md).

1. Use CURL to send the event to the topic. CURL is a utility that sends HTTP requests.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/cloudevents+json" -H "Authorization:SharedAccessKey $key" -d "$event" $publish_operation_uri
   ```

### Receive the event

You receive events from Event Grid using an endpoint that refers to an event subscription. 

1. Compose the endpoint by running the following command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   receive_operation_uri="https://"$(az eventgrid namespace show --resource-group $resource_group --name $namespace --query "topicsConfiguration.hostname" --output tsv)"/topics/"$topic/eventsubscriptions/$event_subscription:receive?api-version=2023-06-01-preview
   ```

1. Submit a request to consume the event:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization:SharedAccessKey $key" $receive_operation_uri
   ```

### Acknowledge an event

After you receive an event, you pass that event to your application for processing. After you successfully process your event, you no longer need that event to be in your event subscription. To instruct Event Grid to delete the event, you **acknowledge** it using its lock token that you got on the receive operation's response. 

1. In the previous section, you received a response that includes a `brokerProperties` object with a `lockToken` property. Copy the lock token value and set it on an environment variable:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   lockToken="<paste-the-lock-token-here>"
   ```

1. Build the acknowledge operation payload, which specifies the lock token for the event you want to be acknowledged.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   acknowledge_request_payload=' { "lockTokens": ["'$lockToken'"]} '
   ```

1. Proceed with building the string with the acknowledge operation URI:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   acknowledge_operation_uri="https://"$(az eventgrid namespace show -g $resource_group -n $namespace --query "topicsConfiguration.hostname" --output tsv)"/topics/"$topic/eventsubscriptions/$event_subscription:acknowledge?api-version=2023-06-01-preview
   ```

1. Finally, submit a request to acknowledge the event received:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization:SharedAccessKey $key" -d "$acknowledge_request_payload" $acknowledge_operation_uri
   ```

   If the acknowledge operation is executed before the lock token expires (300 seconds as set when we created the event subscription), you should see a response like the following example:

   ```json
   {"succeededLockTokens":["CiYKJDQ4NjY5MDEyLTk1OTAtNDdENS1BODdCLUYyMDczNTYxNjcyMxISChDZae43pMpE8J8ovYMSQBZS"],"failedLockTokens":[]}
   ```
