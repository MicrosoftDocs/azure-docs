# Azure Maintenance Configuration as an Event Grid source

This article provides the properties and schema for Azure Maintenance Configurations events. For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](./event-schema.md). It also gives you links to articles to use Maintenance Configuration as an event source.

## Available event types

Maintenance Configuration emits the following event types: 

**Event type** | **Description**
---| ---|
Microsoft.Maintenance.PreMaintenanceEvent | Raised before maintenance job start and gives user an opportunity to perform pre maintenance operations. |
Microsoft.Maintenance.PostMaintenanceEvent | Raised after maintenance job completes and gives an opportunity to perform post maintenance operations. 

## Example event


# [Cloud event schema](#tab/cloud-event-schema)

Following is an example for a schema of a pre-maintenance event:
