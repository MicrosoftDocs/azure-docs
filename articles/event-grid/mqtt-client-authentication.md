# Client authentication

Azure Event Grid's MQTT broker supports the following authentication modes. 

- Certificate-based authentication
- Microsoft Entra ID authentication
- Custom JWT authentication

## Certificate-based authentication
You can use Certificate Authority (CA) signed certificates or self-signed certificates to authenticate clients. For more information, see [MQTT Client authentication using certificates](mqtt-client-certificate-authentication.md).

## Microsoft Entra ID authentication
You can authenticate MQTT clients with Microsoft Entra JWT to connect to Event Grid namespace. You can use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to enable MQTT clients, with Microsoft Entra identity, to publish or subscribe access to specific topic spaces. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra JWT authentication and Azure RBAC authorization to publish or subscribe MQTT messages](mqtt-client-microsoft-entra-token-and-rbac.md). 

## Custom JWT authentication
You can authenticate MQTT clients  using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) issued by any third-party OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider. This authentication method provides a lightweight, secure, and flexible option for MQTT clients that aren't provisioned in Azure. For more information, see [authenticate client using custom JWT](mqtt-client-custom-jwt.md)
