# Azure Event Grid Namespace (Preview) as an Event Grid source
This article provides the properties and schema for Azure Event Grid namespace events. For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). 

## Available event types

Azure Event Grid namespace (Preview) emits the following event types:

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.EventGrid.MQTTClientSessionConnected | Published when an MQTT client’s session is connected to Event Grid. |
| Microsoft.EventGrid.MQTTClientSessionDisconnected | Published when an MQTT client’s session is disconnected from Event Grid. | 
| Microsoft.EventGrid.MQTTClientCreatedOrUpdated | Published when an MQTT client is created or updated in the Event Grid Namespace. |
| Microsoft.EventGrid.MQTTClientDeleted | Published when an MQTT client is deleted from the Event Grid Namespace. |

## Example event

### Event properties

# [Cloud event schema](#tab/cloud-event-schema)

All events contain the same top-level data: 


| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| `source` | string | Full resource path to the event source. This field isn't writeable. Event Grid provides this value. |
| `subject` | string | Publisher-defined path to the event subject. |
| `type` | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. |
| `time` | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| `data` | object | Event Grid namespace event data.  |
| `specversion` | string | CloudEvents schema specification version. |

# [Event Grid event schema](#tab/event-grid-event-schema)

All events contain the same top-level data: 

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| `topic` | string | Full resource path to the event source. This field isn't writeable. Event Grid provides this value. |
| `subject` | string | Publisher-defined path to the event subject. |
| `eventType` | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. |
| `eventTime` | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| `data` | object | Event Grid namespace event data.  |
| `dataVersion` | string | The schema version of the data object. The publisher defines the schema version. |
| `metadataVersion` | string | The schema version of the event metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event Grid provides this value. |

---

The data object contains the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `namespaceName` | string | Name of the Event Grid namespace where the MQTT client was connected or disconnected. |
| `clientAuthenticationName` | string | Unique identifier for the MQTT client that the client presents to the service for authentication. This case-sensitive string can be up to 128 characters long, and supports UTF-8 characters.|
| `clientSessionName` | string | Unique identifier for the MQTT client's session. This case-sensitive string can be up to 128 characters long, and supports UTF-8 characters.|
| `sequenceNumber` | long | A number that helps indicate order of MQTT client session connected or disconnected events. Latest event will have a sequence number that is higher than the previous event. |
| `disconnectionReason` | string | Reason for the disconnection of the MQTT client's session. The value could be one of the values in the disconnection reasons table. |
| `createdOn` | string | The time the client resource is created based on the provider's UTC time. |
| `updatedOn` | string | The time the client resource is last updated based on the provider's UTC time. If the client resource was never updated, this value is identical to the value of the 'createdOn' property |
| `clientName` | string | The time the client resource is last updated based on the provider's UTC time. If the client resource was never updated, this value is identical to the value of the 'createdOn' property. |
| `state` | string | The configured state of the client. The value could be Enabled or Disabled.|
| `attributes` | string | The array of key-value pair attributes that are assigned to the client resource.|

### Disconnection reasons:

The following list details the different values for the disconnectionReason and their description:

| SessionOverflow                     | the client's queue for unacknowledged QoS1 messages reached its limit, which resulted in a connection termination by the server                                                                          |
