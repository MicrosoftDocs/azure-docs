# HTTP Publish of MQTT messages with Azure Event Grid (preview)

The Azure Event Grid MQTT Broker HTTP Publish API empowers customers to publish Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) messages by using standard HTTP requests. This capability complements direct MQTT client connections. It provides a simple and scalable option for server-side systems that prefer HTTP for server-to-device command and control, updates, or retained message management.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in preview.

Key benefits:

- Allows back-end services to send MQTT messages without keeping persistent MQTT sessions open.
- Helps protect broker stability by limiting per-client MQTT sessions.
- Ensures consistent processing for messages that originate from MQTT and HTTP.

## When to use HTTP Publish

Consider using HTTP Publish when:

- Your back-end services are HTTP native and need to send device commands or updates over MQTT.
- You want to manage retained messages without opening an MQTT connection.
- You need to scale up publishing capacity without exhausting session limits.

## How it works

1. HTTP clients issue an HTTP `POST` request with MQTT Publish details.
1. Event Grid maps HTTP request parts to standard MQTT PUBLISH packet properties.
1. Messages flow through the Event Grid routing and enrichment pipeline, which ensures delivery guarantees and applies any enrichment or transformation.

## Example: MQTT Publish equivalent

```http
PUBLISH Topic Name: devices/CXa-23112/prompt  
QoS: 1  
RETAIN: 0  
Response Topic: devices/CXa-23112/reply  
Correlation Data: >U±¶¶»/  
User Property: Urgency = alert  
User Property: RequestId = 55f4a7ee-b0b4-4d7f-8eb5-2edba2ced5d7  
Payload: Please accept terms of licensing and agreement
```

## Example: HTTP Publish request

```http
POST /mqtt/messages?topic=devices%2FCXa-23112%2Fprompt&api-version=2025-02-15-preview HTTP/1.1  
Host: nsname.westus3-1.ts.eventgrid.azure.net  
Authorization: Bearer <ENTRA_TOKEN_HERE>  
mqtt-qos: 1  
mqtt-retain: 0  
mqtt-response-topic: devices%2FCXa-23112%2Freply  
mqtt-correlation-data: PlXCscK2wrbCuy8=  
mqtt-user-properties: W3siVXJnZW5jeSI6ImFsZXJ0In0seyJSZXF1ZXN0SWQiOiI1NWY0YTdlZS1iMGI0LTRkN2YtOGViNS0yZWRiYTJjZWQ1ZDcifV0=

## Request parameters

The following table describes how HTTP request parts map to MQTT PUBLISH packet properties. Refer to the original documentation for full details.

| MQTT Publish part    | Type/Values        | Location                               | Required       | Description                |
|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Topic name               | Percent-encoded string | Query `topic`                              | Yes                | MQTT topic to publish to      |
| QoS                      | 0 or 1                 | Query `qos` or header `mqtt-qos`           | No [default = 1]   | Quality of Service (QoS) level      |
| `RETAIN` flag            | 0 or 1                 | Query `retain` or header `mqtt-retain`     | No [default = 0]   | Whether to retain the message |
| Response topic           | Percent-encoded string | Header `mqtt-response-topic`               | No                 | Response topic if needed      |
| Correlation data         | Base64 string          | Header `mqtt-correlation-data`             | No                 | Extra data for tracking       |
| User properties          | Base64 JSON array      | Header `mqtt-user-properties`              | No                 | Custom user properties        |
| Content type             | String                 | Header `content-type`                      | No                 | Payload type                 |
| Message expiry interval  | Unsigned integer       | Header `mqtt-message-expiry`               | No                 | Retention period in seconds  |
| Payload format indicator | 0 or 1                 | Header `mqtt-payload-format-indicator`     | No [default = 0]   | Format indicator              |
| Payload                  | Bytes                  | HTTP body                                  | No                 | Message body                  |

Notes:

- Query parameter values override header values if both are present.
- Percent encoding is required for topic and response topic.
- Correlation data must be Base64-encoded.

## High-level steps for using HTTP Publish

1. Prepare your Microsoft Entra ID bearer token for authentication.
2. Construct your HTTP `POST` request to your Event Grid MQTT broker endpoint.
3. Include required query parameters, like topic.
4. Add optional headers for QoS, the `RETAIN` flag, response topic, and user properties.
5. Add your payload as the HTTP body.
6. Send the request.
7. Confirm delivery via logs and metrics in the Event Grid portal.

## Authentication and authorization

- HTTP Publish uses Microsoft Entra ID for authentication.
- A bearer token is needed in the authorization header.
- The Microsoft Entra Object ID becomes the MQTT client ID.
- The AuthN/AuthZ model aligns with standard MQTT connections.

## Routing and observability

Metrics and logs include:

- Protocol: `http-publish`
- Request ID
- Topic
- Source IP
- Authorization principal

## Best practices

- Use lowercase header keys where possible. HTTP/2 header keys are case insensitive.
- Monitor throughput because HTTP messages tend to be larger than direct MQTT messages.
- Observe that HTTP Publish shares throughput limits with direct MQTT published messages.

## Throttling

HTTP Publish counts toward your overall MQTT throughput quota. Monitor your usage to avoid exceeding limits.
