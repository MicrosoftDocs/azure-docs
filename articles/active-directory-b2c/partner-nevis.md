# Tutorial to configure Nevis with Azure Active Directory B2C for passwordless authentication

In this tutorial, learn to enable passwordless authentication in Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) with the Nevis Access app to enable customer authentication and comply with Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) transaction requirements. PSD2 is a European Union (EU) directive, administered by the European Commission (Directorate General Internal Market) to regulate payment services and payment service providers throughout the EU and European Economic Area (EEA).  

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need:

- A Nevis demo account
  - Go to `nevis.net` for [Nevis + Microsoft Azure AD B2C](https://www.nevis-security.com/aadb2c/) to request an account

- An Azure subscription

  - If you don't have one, you can get an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

- An [Azure AD B2C tenant](./tutorial-create-tenant.md) linked to your Azure subscription

>[!NOTE]
>To integrate Nevis into your sign-up policy flow, configure the Azure AD B2C environment to use custom policies. </br>See, [Tutorial: Create user flows and custom policies in Azure Active Directory B2C](./tutorial-create-user-flows.md).

## Scenario description

Add the branded Access app to your back-end application for passwordless authentication. The following components make up the solution:

- **Azure AD B2C tenant** with a combined sign-in and sign-up policy for your back end
- **Nevis instance** and its REST API to enhance Azure AD B2C
- Your branded **Access** app

The diagram shows the implementation.

1. A user attempts sign-in or sign-up to an application with Azure AD B2C policy.
2. During sign-up, the Access is registered to the user device using a QR code. A private key is generated on the user device and is used to sign user requests.
3. Azure AD B2C uses a RESTful technical profile to start sign-in with the Nevis solution.
4. The sign-in request goes to Access, as a push message, QR code, or a deep-link.
5. The user approves the sign-in attempt with their biometrics. A message goes to Nevis, which verifies sign-in with the stored public key.
6. Azure AD B2C sends a request to Nevis to confirm sign-in is complete.
7. The user is granted, or denied, access to the application with an Azure AD B2C success, or failure, message.

## Integrate your Azure AD B2C tenant

### Request a Nevis account 

1. Go to `nevis.net` for [Nevis + Microsoft Azure AD B2C](https://www.nevis-security.com/aadb2c/).
2. Use the form request an account.
3. Two emails arrive:

- Management account notification
- Mobile app invitation

### Add your Azure AD B2C tenant to your Nevis account

2. In a browser, open the [Nevis management console](https://console.nevis.cloud/).
3. Use the management key to sign in to the management console.
4. Select **Add Instance**.
5. Select the created instance.
6. In the side navigation, select **Custom Integrations**.
