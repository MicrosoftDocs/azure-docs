## Create an application

To enable sign-in for users with an X account in Azure AD B2C, you need to create an X application. If you don't already have an X account, you can sign up at [`https://x.com/signup`](https://x.com/signup). You also need to [Apply for a developer account](https://developer.x.com/). For more information, see [Apply for access](https://developer.x.com/en/apply-for-access).

1. Select **+ Create Project** button. 
1. Under **Project name** tab, enter a preferred name of your project, and then select **Next** button.
1. Under **Use case** tab, select your preferred use case, and then select **Next**.

## Configure X as an identity provider

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with an account that has at least [External Identity Provider Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#external-identity-provider-administrator) privileges.
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Azure AD B2C tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Select **Identity providers**, then select **Twitter**.
1. Enter a **Name**. For example, *X*.
1. For the **Client ID**, enter the *API Key* of the X application that you created earlier.
1. For the **Client secret**, enter the *API key secret* that you recorded.
1. Select **Save**.

## Add X identity provider to a user flow 

At this point, the X identity provider has been set up, but it's not yet available in any of the sign-in pages. To add the X identity provider to a user flow:

1. In your Azure AD B2C tenant, select **User flows**.
1. Select the user flow that you want to add the X identity provider.
1. Under the **Social identity providers**, select **Twitter**.
1. Select **Save**.

## Test your User Flow

1. To test your policy, select **Run user flow**.
1. For **Application**, select the web application named *testapp1* that you previously registered. The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.
1. Select the **Run user flow** button.
1. From the sign-up or sign-in page, select **Twitter** to sign in with X account.

## Create a policy key

You need to store the secret key that you previously recorded for X app in your Azure AD B2C tenant.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Azure AD B2C tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. On the left menu, under **Policies**, select **Identity Experience Framework**.
1. Select **Policy Keys** and then select **Add**.
1. For **Options**, choose `Manual`.
1. Enter a **Name** for the policy key. For example, `XSecret`. The prefix `B2C_1A_` is added automatically to the name of your key.
1. For **Secret**, enter your *API key secret* value that you previously recorded.
1. For **Key usage**, select `Signature`.
1. Click **Create**.

## Configure X as an identity provider

To enable users to sign in using an X account, you need to define the account as a claims provider that Azure AD B2C can communicate with through an endpoint. The endpoint provides a set of claims that are used by Azure AD B2C to verify that a specific user has authenticated.

You can define an X account as a claims provider by adding it to the **ClaimsProviders** element in the extension file of your policy. Refer to the custom policy starter pack that you downloaded in the Prerequisites of this article.

1. Open the *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml*.
2. Find the **ClaimsProviders** element. If it does not exist, add it under the root element.
3. Add a new **ClaimsProvider** as follows:

    ```xml
    <ClaimsProvider>
      <Domain>x.com</Domain>
      <DisplayName>X</DisplayName>
      <TechnicalProfiles>
        <TechnicalProfile Id="Twitter-OAuth1">
          <DisplayName>X</DisplayName>
          <Protocol Name="OAuth1" />
          <Metadata>
            <Item Key="ProviderName">Twitter</Item>
            <Item Key="authorization_endpoint">https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate</Item>
            <Item Key="access_token_endpoint">https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token</Item>
            <Item Key="request_token_endpoint">https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token</Item>
            <Item Key="ClaimsEndpoint">https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/verify_credentials.json?include_email=true</Item>
            <Item Key="ClaimsResponseFormat">json</Item>
            <Item Key="client_id">Your X application API key</Item>
          </Metadata>
          <CryptographicKeys>
            <Key Id="client_secret" StorageReferenceId="B2C_1A_TwitterSecret" />
          </CryptographicKeys>
          <OutputClaims>
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="issuerUserId" PartnerClaimType="user_id" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="displayName" PartnerClaimType="screen_name" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="email" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="identityProvider" DefaultValue="twitter.com" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="authenticationSource" DefaultValue="socialIdpAuthentication" />
          </OutputClaims>
          <OutputClaimsTransformations>
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateRandomUPNUserName" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateUserPrincipalName" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateAlternativeSecurityId" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateSubjectClaimFromAlternativeSecurityId" />
          </OutputClaimsTransformations>
          <UseTechnicalProfileForSessionManagement ReferenceId="SM-SocialLogin" />
        </TechnicalProfile>
      </TechnicalProfiles>
    </ClaimsProvider>
    ```

4. Replace the value of **client_id** with the *API key* that you previously recorded.
5. Save the file.

```

## Test your custom policy

1. Select your relying party policy, for example `B2C_1A_signup_signin`.
1. For **Application**, select a web application that you [previously registered](tutorial-register-applications.md). The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.
1. Select the **Run now** button.
1. From the sign-up or sign-in page, select **Twitter** to sign in with X account.
::: zone-end

If the sign-in process is successful, your browser is redirected to `https://jwt.ms`, which displays the contents of the token returned by Azure AD B2C.

> [!TIP]
>  If you're facing `unauthorized` error while testing this identity provider, make sure you use the correct X API Key and API Key Secret, or try to apply for [elevated](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/products/elevated) access. Also, we recommend you've a look at [X's projects structure](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/projects/overview), if you registered your app before the feature was available.
