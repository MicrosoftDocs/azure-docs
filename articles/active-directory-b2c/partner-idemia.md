# Tutorial: Configure IDEMIA Mobile ID with Azure Active Directory B2C 

## Before you begin

Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) has two methods to define users interaction with applications: predefined user flows or configurable custom policies. See, [User flows and custom policies overview](./user-flow-overview.md)

## Integrate Azure AD B2C with IDEMIA Mobile ID

IDEMIA provides biometric authentication services like face ID and fingerprinting, which reduces fraud and credential reuse. With Mobile ID, citizens benefit from a trusted, government-issued digital ID, as a complement to their physical ID. Mobile ID verifies identity by using a self-selected PIN, touch ID, or face ID. Citizens control their identities by sharing information needed for a transaction. Many state departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) use Mobile ID.

To learn more, go to idemia.com: [IDEMIA](https://www.idemia.com/)

## Scenario description

Mobile ID integration includes the following components:

* **Azure AD B2C** – authorization server that verifies user credentials
  * It's also known as the identity provider (IdP)
* **IDEMIA Mobile ID** - OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider configured as an Azure AD B2C external provider
  * See, [Add an identity provider to your Azure AD B2C tenant](add-identity-provider.md)
* **IDEMIA Mobile ID application** - a digital version of a driver’s license, or state-issued ID, in an app on your phone
  * See, [IDEMIA Mobile ID](https://idemia-mobile-id.com/)

Mobile ID is a digitized identification document, a portable mobile identity token that DMVs use to verify individual identities. The signed digitized ID is stored on user mobile phones as an identity on the edge. The signed credentials ease access to identity services such as proof of age, financial know your customer, account access, etc.

The following diagram illustrates the sign-up and sign-in user flows with Mobile ID.

![Diagram of the sign-up and sign-in user flows with Mobile ID.](./media/partner-idemia/idemia-architecture-diagram.png)

1. User visits the Azure AD B2C sign-in page (the replying party), with their device and Mobile ID, to conduct a transaction.
2. Azure AD B2C performs an ID check. It redirects the user to the IDEMIA router with an OIDC authorization code flow.
3. The router sends a biometric challenge to the user’s mobile app with authentication and authorization request details.
4. Depending on security, the user might be prompted provide more details: input a PIN, take a live selfie, or both.
5. The authentication response provides proof of possession, presence, and consent. The response returns to the router.
6. The router verifies user information and replies to Azure AD B2C with the result.
7. The user is granted or denied access.

## Enable Mobile ID

To get started, go to the idemia.com [Get in touch](https://www.idemia.com/get-touch/) page to request a demo. In the request form text field, indicate your interest in Azure AD B2C integration.

## Integrate Mobile ID with Azure AD B2C

Use the following sections to prepare for and perform integration processes. 

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need:

* Access to users with an IDEMIA, US state issued Mobile ID credential (mID) 
  * Or during the test phase, the mID demo application from IDEMIA
* An Azure subscription

  * If you don't have one, get an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* An [Azure AD B2C tenant](tutorial-create-tenant.md) linked to the Azure subscription
* Your business web application registered in an Azure AD B2C tenant
  * For testing, configure https://jwt.ms, a Microsoft web application with decoded token contents

   >[!NOTE]
   >The token contents don't leave your browser.

### Submit a relying party application for mID

During Mobile ID integration, the following information is provided.

| Property | Description |
|:---------|:----------|
| Application Name | Azure AD B2C, or another application name |
| Client_ID | The unique identifier from the identity provider (IdP) |
| Client Secret | Password the relying party application uses to authenticate with the IDEMIA IdP |
| Metadata endpoint | A URL pointing to a token issuer configuration document, also known as an OpenID well-known configuration endpoint |
|Redirect URIs | `https://your-B2C-tenant-name.b2clogin.com/your-B2C-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`<br>For  example, `https://fabrikam.b2clogin.com/fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`<br><br>If you use a custom domain, enter `https://your-domain-name/your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`.|
|Post sign out redirect URIs | `https://your-B2C-tenant-name.b2clogin.com/your-B2C-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/{policy}/oauth2/v2.0/logout`<br>Send a sign out request. |

   >[!NOTE]
   >You need the Client ID and Client Secret later to configure the IdP in Azure AD B2C.

### Create a policy key

Store the noted IDEMIA Client Secret in your Azure AD B2C tenant. For the following instructions, use the directory with your Azure AD B2C tenant. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the portal toolbar, select **Directories + subscriptions**.
3. On the **Portal settings, Directories + subscriptions** page, in the **Directory name** list find your Azure AD B2C directory
4. Select **Switch**.
5. In the top-left corner of Azure portal, select **All services**.
6. Search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
7. On the **Overview** page, select **Identity Experience Framework**.
8. Select **Policy Keys**.
9. Select **Add**.
10. For **Options**, choose **Manual**.
11. Enter a **Name** for the policy key. For example, `IdemiaAppSecret`. The prefix `B2C_1A_` is added to the key name.
12. In **Secret**, enter the Client Secret you noted.
13. For **Key** usage, select **Signature**.
14. Select **Create**.

### Configure Mobile ID as an External IdP

To enable users to sign in with Mobile ID, define IDEMIA as a claims provider. This action ensures Azure AD B2C communicates through an endpoint, which provides claims Azure AD B2C uses to verify user authentication with biometry. 

To define IDEMIA as a claims provider, add it to the **ClaimsProvider** element in the policy extension file.

```PowerShell
     <TechnicalProfile Id="Idemia-Oauth2">
          <DisplayName>IDEMIA</DisplayName>
          <Description>Login with your IDEMIA identity</Description>
          <Protocol Name="OAuth2" />
          <Metadata>
            <Item Key="METADATA">https://idp.XXXX.net/oxauth/.well-known/openid-configuration</Item>
            <!-- Update the Client ID below to the Application ID -->
            <Item Key="client_id">00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444</Item>
            <Item Key="response_types">code</Item>
            <Item Key="scope">openid id_basic mt_scope</Item>
            <Item Key="response_mode">form_post</Item>
            <Item Key="HttpBinding">POST</Item>

          </Metadata>
          <CryptographicKeys>
            <Key Id="client_secret" StorageReferenceId="B2C_1A_IdemiaAppSecret" />
</CryptographicKeys>
          <InputClaims>
            <InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="acr" PartnerClaimType="acr_values" DefaultValue="loa-2" />
          </InputClaims>
          <OutputClaims>
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="issuerUserId" PartnerClaimType="sub" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="tenantId" PartnerClaimType="tid" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="givenName" PartnerClaimType="firstName1" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="surName" PartnerClaimType="lastName1" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="authenticationSource" DefaultValue="socialIdpAuthentication" AlwaysUseDefaultValue="true" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="identityProvider" DefaultValue="idemia" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="documentId" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="address1" />
          </OutputClaims>
          <OutputClaimsTransformations>
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateRandomUPNUserName" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateUserPrincipalName" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateAlternativeSecurityId" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateSubjectClaimFromAlternativeSecurityId" />
          </OutputClaimsTransformations>
          <UseTechnicalProfileForSessionManagement ReferenceId="SM-SocialLogin" />
        </TechnicalProfile>
           
```

Set client_id to the application ID from the application registration.

|Property | Description|
|---|---|
|Scope| For OpenID Connect (OIDC), the minimum requirement is set scope parameter to **openid**. Append more scopes as a space-delimited list.|
|redirect_uri | This location is where the user agent sends the authorization code to Azure AD B2C.|
|response_type| For the authorization code flow, select **code**|
|acr_values| This parameter controls the authentication methods the user must perform during authentication. |

Select one of the following values:

|Parameter value| Effect on user authentication process |
|---|---|
|`loa-2`| Crypto-based Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication only|
|`loa-3`| Crypto-based MFA, plus another factor|
|`loa-4`| Crypto-based MFA, plus the user performs PIN and biometric authentication |

The **/userinfo** endpoint provides the claims for the scope(s) requested in the authorization request. For the **<mt_scope>**, there are claims like First Name, Last Name, and Driver's License Number, among other items.
The claims set for a scope are published in the **scope_to_claims_mapping** section of the discovery API.
Azure AD B2C requests claims from the claims endpoint and returns them in the OutputClaims element. You might need to map the claim name in your policy to the name in the IdP. Define the claim type in the [ClaimSchema element](claimsschema.md):

```PowerShell
<ClaimType Id="documentId">
     <DisplayName>documentId</DisplayName>
     <DataType>string</DataType>
</ClaimType>
<ClaimType Id="address1">
     <DisplayName>address</DisplayName>
     <DataType>string</DataType>
</ClaimType>
```

### Add a user journey

For these instructions, the IdP is set up, but it's not in any sign-in page. If you don't have a custom user journey, copy a template user journey.

1. From the starter pack, open the `TrustFrameworkBase.xml` file.
2. Locate and copy the contents of the `UserJourneys` element, which includes `ID=SignUpOrSignIn`.
3. Open the `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml`.
4. Locate the **UserJourneys** element. If there's no element, add one.
5. Paste the contents of the **UserJourney** element as a child of the UserJourneys element.
6. Rename the user journey ID. For example, `ID=CustomSignUpSignIn`.

### Add the IdP to a user journey

If there's a user journey, add the new IdP to it. First add a sign-in button, then link it to an action, which is the technical profile you created.

1. In the user journey, locate the orchestration step element with Type=`CombinedSignInAndSignUp`, or Type=`ClaimsProviderSelection`. It's usually the first orchestration step. The **ClaimsProviderSelections** element has an IdP list users sign in with. The order of the elements controls is the order of the sign-in buttons the user sees. 
2. Add a **ClaimsProviderSelection** XML element. 
3. Set the **TargetClaimsExchangeId** value to a friendly name.
4. Add a **ClaimsExchange** element. 
5. Set the **Id** to the value of the target claims exchange ID. 
6. Update the **TechnicalProfileReferenceId** value to the technical profile ID you created.

The following XML demonstrates the first two orchestration steps of a user journey with the IdP:

```xml
<OrchestrationStep Order="1" Type="CombinedSignInAndSignUp" ContentDefinitionReferenceId="api.signuporsignin">
  <ClaimsProviderSelections>
    ...
    <ClaimsProviderSelection TargetClaimsExchangeId="IdemiaExchange" />
  </ClaimsProviderSelections>
  ...
</OrchestrationStep>

<OrchestrationStep Order="2" Type="ClaimsExchange">
  ...
  <ClaimsExchanges>
    <ClaimsExchange Id="IdemiaExchange" TechnicalProfileReferenceId="Idemia-Oauth2" />
  </ClaimsExchanges>
</OrchestrationStep>
```

### Configure the relying party policy

The relying party policy, for example [SignUpSignIn.xml](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack/blob/master/SocialAndLocalAccounts/SignUpOrSignin.xml), specifies the user journey the Azure AD B2C executes. 

1. Find the **DefaultUserJourney** element in relying party. 
2. Update the **ReferenceId** to match the user journey ID, in which you added the IdP.

In the following example, for the `CustomSignUpOrSignIn` user journey, the **ReferenceId** is set to `CustomSignUpOrSignIn`.
 
```xml
<RelyingParty>
  <DefaultUserJourney ReferenceId="CustomSignUpSignIn" />
  ...
</RelyingParty>
```

### Upload the custom policy

For the following instructions, use the directory with your Azure AD B2C tenant.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
2. In the portal toolbar, select the **Directories + subscriptions**.
3. On the **Portal settings, Directories + subscriptions** page, in the **Directory name** list, find your Azure AD B2C directory. 
4. Select **Switch**.
5. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
6. Under **Policies**, select **Identity Experience Framework**.
7. Select **Upload Custom Policy**.
8. Upload the two policy files you changed, in the following order: 

     * The extension policy, for example `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml`
     * The relying party policy, such as `SignUpSignIn.xml`

### Test your custom policy

1. Select your relying party policy, for example `B2C_1A_signup_signin`.
2. For **Application**, select a web application you registered. 
3. `https://jwt.ms`appears for **Reply URL**.
4. Select **Run now**.
5. From the sign-up or sign-in page, select **IDEMIA**.
6. The browser is redirected to `https://jwt.ms`. See the token contents returned by Azure AD B2C.
