#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to automate the deployment of Azure Active Directory B2C custom policies using GitHub Actions, so that I can easily manage and deploy my custom policies without manual intervention.

# Deploy custom policies with GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/quickstart) allows you to create custom continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) workflows directly in your GitHub repository. This article describes how to automate the deployment of Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) [custom policies](user-flow-overview.md) using GitHub Actions.

To automate the custom policy deployment process, use the [GitHub Action for deploying Azure AD B2C custom policies](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-azure-ad-b2c-custom-policy). This GitHub Action has developed by the [Azure AD B2C community](https://github.com/azure-ad-b2c/deploy-trustframework-policy). 

This action deploys Azure AD B2C custom policies into your Azure AD B2C tenant using the [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/api/resources/trustframeworkpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). If the policy does not yet exist in your tenant, it will be created. Otherwise, it will be replaced.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Managing Azure AD B2C custom policies with Azure Pipelines currently uses **preview** operations available on the Microsoft Graph API `/beta` endpoint. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. For more information, see the [Microsoft Graph REST API beta endpoint reference](/graph/api/overview?toc=./ref/toc.json&view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

## Prerequisites

* Complete the steps in [Get started with custom policies in Active Directory B2C](tutorial-create-user-flows.md).
* If you haven't created GitHub repo, [create one](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).  

## Select a custom policies folder

Your GitHub repository can contain all of your Azure AD B2C policy files and other assets. In the root directory of your repository, create or choose an existing folder that contains your custom policies. 

For example, select a folder named *policies*. Add your Azure AD B2C custom policy files to the *policies* folder. Then **Commit** the changes.

Do not **Push** the changes. You will do this later, after you set up the deployment workflow.

## Register a Microsoft Graph application

To allow the GitHub Action to interact with the [Microsoft Graph API](microsoft-graph-operations.md), create an application registration in your Azure AD B2C tenant. If you haven't already done so, [register a Microsoft Graph application](microsoft-graph-get-started.md).

For the GitHub Action to access data in Microsoft Graph, grant the registered application the relevant [application permissions](/graph/permissions-reference). Grant the **Microsoft Graph** > **Policy** > **Policy.ReadWrite.TrustFramework** permission within the **API Permissions** of the app registration.

## Create a GitHub encrypted secret

GitHub secrets are encrypted environment variables that you create in an organization, repository, or repository environment. In this step, you store the application secret for the application you registered earlier in the [Register an MS Graph application](#register-a-microsoft-graph-application) step.

The GitHub Action for deploying Azure AD B2C custom policies uses the secret to acquire an access token that is used to interact with the Microsoft Graph API. For more information, see [Creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

To create a GitHub secret, follow these steps:

1. In GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. Under your repository name, select **Settings**.
1. In the left sidebar, select **Secrets**.
1. Select **New repository secret**.
1. For the **Name**, type **ClientSecret**.
1. For the **Value**, enter the application secret you created earlier.
1. Select **Add secret**.

## Create a GitHub workflow

The GitHub workflow is an automated procedure that you add to your repository. Workflows are made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event. In this step, you create a workflow the deploys your custom policy.

To create a workflow, follow these steps:

1. In GitHub, navigate to the main page of your repository.
1. Under your repository name, select **Actions**.

1. If you didn't configure a workflow before, select **set up a workflow yourself**. Otherwise, select **New Workflow**.

   ![Screenshot showing how to create a new workflow](media/deploy-custom-policies-github-action/set-up-a-workflow.png)

1. GitHub offers to create a workflow file named `main.yml` in the `.github/workflows` folder. This file contains information about the workflow, including your Azure AD B2C environment and the custom policies to deploy. In the GitHub web editor, add the following YAML code:

    ```yml
    on: push

    env:
      clientId: 00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444
      tenant: your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com
    
    jobs:
      build-and-deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
        - name: 'Upload TrustFrameworkBase Policy'
          uses: azure-ad-b2c/deploy-trustframework-policy@v3
          with:
            folder: "./Policies"
            files: "TrustFrameworkBase.xml,TrustFrameworkLocalization.xml,TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml,SignUpOrSignin.xml"
            tenant: ${{ env.tenant }}
            clientId: ${{ env.clientId }}
            clientSecret: ${{ secrets.clientSecret }}
    ```

1.  Update the following properties of the YAML file:

    | Section| Name | Value |
    | ---- | ----- |----- |
    | `env` | `clientId` | **Application (client) ID** of the application you registered in the [Register an MS Graph application](#register-a-microsoft-graph-application) step. |
    |`env`| `tenant` | Your Azure AD B2C [tenant name]( tenant-management-read-tenant-name.md#get-your-tenant-name) (for example, contoso.onmicrosoft.com). |
    | `with`| `folder`| A folder where the custom policies files are stored, for example, `./Policies`.|
    | `with`| `files` | Comma-delimited list of policy files to deploy, for example, `TrustFrameworkBase.xml,TrustFrameworkLocalization.xml,TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml,SignUpOrSignin.xml`.|
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When running the agents and uploading the policy files, make sure they're uploaded in the correct order:
    >
    > 1. *TrustFrameworkBase.xml*
    > 1. *TrustFrameworkLocalization.xml*
    > 1. *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml*
    > 1. *SignUpOrSignin.xml*
    > 1. *ProfileEdit.xml*
    > 1. *PasswordReset.xml*

1. Select **Start commit**.
1. Below the commit message fields, indicate whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. Select **Commit new file**, or **Propose new file** to create a pull request.

## Test your workflow

To test the workflow you created, **Push** the changes of your custom policy. Once your job has started running, you can see a visualization graph of the run's progress and view each step's activity on GitHub.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of your repository.
1. Under your repository name, select **Actions**.
1. In the left sidebar, select the workflow you created.
1. Under **Workflow runs**, select the name of the run you want to see.

   ![Screenshot showing how to select workflow activity](media/deploy-custom-policies-github-action/workflow-report.png)

1. Under **Jobs** or in the visualization graph, select the job you want to see.
1. View the results of each step. The following screenshot demonstrates the **Upload custom policy** step log.

## Optional: Schedule your workflow

The workflow you created is triggered by the [push](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#push) event. If you prefer, you can choose another event to trigger the workflow, for example a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request).

You can also schedule a workflow to run at specific UTC times using [POSIX cron syntax](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07). The schedule event allows you to trigger a workflow at a scheduled time. For more information, see [Scheduled events](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events).

The following example triggers the workflow every day at 5:30 and 17:30 UTC:

```yml
on:
  schedule:
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron:  '30 5,17 * * *'
```

To edit your workflow:

1. In GitHub, navigate to the main page of your repository.
1. Under your repository name, select **Actions**.
1. In the left sidebar, select the workflow you created.
1. Under **Workflow runs**, select the name of the run you want to see.
1. From the menu, select the three dots **...**, and then select **View the workflow file**.

   ![Screenshot showing how to view the workflow file](media/deploy-custom-policies-github-action/edit-workflow.png)
   
1. In the GitHub web editor, select **Edit**.
1. Change `on: push` to the example above.
1. **Commit** your changes.
