#Customer intent: As a user completing a verification process, I want to enter my email address or phone number and receive a verification code, so that I can verify my identity and proceed to the next step.

# Verification display control

Use a verification [display control](display-controls.md) to verify a claim, for example an email address or phone number, with a verification code sent to the user.

## VerificationControl actions

The verification display control consists of two steps (actions):

1. Request a destination from the user, such as an email address or phone number, to which the verification code should be sent. When the user selects the **Send Code** button, the **SendCode Action** of the verification display control is executed. The **SendCode Action** generates a code, constructs the content to be sent, and sends it to the user. The value of the address can be pre-populated and serve as a second-factor authentication.

1. After the code has been sent, the user reads the message, enters the verification code into the control provided by the display control, and selects **Verify Code**. By selecting **Verify Code**, the **VerifyCode Action** is executed to verify the code associated with the address. If the user selects **Send New Code**, the first action is executed again.

## VerificationControl required elements

The **VerificationControl** must contain following elements:

- The type of the `DisplayControl` is `VerificationControl`.
- `DisplayClaims`
  - **Send to** - One or more claims specifying where to send the verification code to. For example, *email* or *country code* and *phone number*.
  - **Verification code** - The verification code claim that user provides after the code has been sent. This claim must be set as required, and the `ControlClaimType` must be set to `VerificationCode`.
- Output claim (optional) to be returned to the self-asserted page after the user completes verification process. For example, *email* or *country code* and *phone number*. The self-asserted technical profile uses the claims to persist the data or bubble up the output claims to the next orchestration step.
- Two `Action`s with following names:
  - **SendCode** - Sends a code to the user. This action usually contains two validation technical profile, to generate a code and to send it.
  - **VerifyCode** - Verifies the code. This action usually contains a single validation technical profile.

In the example below, an **email** textbox is displayed on the page. When the user enters their email address and selects **SendCode**, the **SendCode** action is triggered in the Azure AD B2C back end.

Then, the user enters the **verificationCode** and selects **VerifyCode** to trigger the **VerifyCode** action in the back end. If all validations pass, the **VerificationControl** is considered complete and the user can continue to the next step.

<DisplayControl Id="emailVerificationControl" UserInterfaceControlType="VerificationControl">

    <DisplayClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="verificationCode" ControlClaimType="VerificationCode" Required="true" />
  </DisplayClaims>
  <OutputClaims>
    <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="email" />
  </OutputClaims>

```
