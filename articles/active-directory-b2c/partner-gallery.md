# Azure Active Directory B2C ISV partners

Our ISV partner network extends our solution capabilities to help you build seamless end-user experiences. With Azure AD B2C, you can integrate with ISV partners to enable multifactor authentication (MFA) methods, do role-based access control, enable identity verification and proofing, improve security with bot detection and fraud protection, and meet Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) Secure Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements. Use our detailed sample walkthroughs to learn how to integrate apps with the ISV partners. 

To be considered into this sample documentation, submit your application request in the [Microsoft Application Network portal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/apponboarding/Apps/SitePages/Default.aspx). For any additional questions, send an email to [SaaSApplicationIntegrations@service.microsoft.com](mailto:SaaSApplicationIntegrations@service.microsoft.com).
