# Find help and open a support ticket for Azure Active Directory B2C

Microsoft provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support for Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C). Support is available both online and by phone for Microsoft Azure paid and trial subscriptions. Phone support and online billing support are available in additional languages.

## Find help without opening a support ticket

Before creating a support ticket, check out the following resources for answers and information. 

* For content such as how-to information or code samples for IT professionals and developers, see the [technical documentation for Azure AD B2C](../active-directory-b2c/index.yml).

* The [Microsoft Technical Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/) is the place for our IT pro partners and customers to collaborate, share, and learn. The [Microsoft Technical Community Info Center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/community-lounge/ct-p/Community-Info-Center) is used for announcements, blog posts, ask-me-anything (AMA) interactions with experts, and more. You can also [join the community to submit your ideas](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Communities/ct-p/communities).

## Open a support ticket

If you're unable to find answers by using self-help resources, you can open an online support ticket. You should open each support ticket for only a single problem to enable us to connect you to the support engineers who are subject matter experts for your problem. Also, Azure AD B2C engineering teams prioritize their work based on incidents that are generated, so you're often contributing to service improvements.

### How to open a support ticket for Azure AD B2C in the Azure portal

> [!NOTE]

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Microsoft Entra tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu. Currently, you can't submit support cases directly from your Azure AD B2C tenant.
     
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. In the left menu, under **Troubleshooting + Support**, select **New support request**.
   
1. On the **1. Problem description** tab: 

    1. For **Issue type**, select **Technical**.

    1. For **Subscription**, select your Azure subscription.

    1. For **Service type**, select **Azure Active Directory Business to Consumer (B2C)**. This action shows **Summary** and **Problem type** fields.

    1. Additional details to describe the problem. 
   
    1. Under **Advanced diagnostic information**, select **Yes (Recommended)** to allow Microsoft support to access your Azure resources for faster problem resolution. 
    
    1. Select a **[Severity](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/response)**, and your preferred contact method.
