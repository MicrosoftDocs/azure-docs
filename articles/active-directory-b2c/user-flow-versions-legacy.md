#Customer intent: As a developer using Azure Active Directory B2C, I want to understand the differences between legacy and recommended user flow versions, so that I can choose the appropriate user flow for my production applications.

# Legacy user flow versions in Azure Active Directory B2C

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article describes the legacy versioning method for user flows, which offers V1 (production-ready) versions, and V1.1 and V2 (preview) versions of user flows. Environments other than the Azure public cloud will continue to use this legacy versioning method. In the Azure public cloud, this method being replaced by [new **Recommended** and **Preview** versions](user-flow-versions.md).

User flows in Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) help you to set up common [policies](user-flow-overview.md) that fully describe customer identity experiences. These experiences include sign-up, sign-in, password reset, or profile editing.

In the table below, unless a user flow is identified as **Recommended**, it is considered to be in *preview*. You should use only recommended user flows for your production applications.
