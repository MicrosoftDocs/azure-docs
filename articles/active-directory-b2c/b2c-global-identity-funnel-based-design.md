# Build a global identity solution with funnel-based approach

In this article, we describe the scenarios for funnel-based design approach. Before starting to design, it's recommended that you review the [capabilities](b2c-global-identity-solutions.md#capabilities-and-considerations), and [performance](b2c-global-identity-solutions.md#performance) of both funnel and region-based design approach. This article will further help determine which design may fit best for your organization.

The designs account for:

* Local Account sign up and sign in
* Federated account sign up and sign in
* Authenticating local accounts for users signing in from outside their registered region, supported by cross tenant API based authentication
* Authenticating federated accounts for users signing in from outside their registered region, supported by cross tenant API based look up
* Prevents sign up from multiple different regions
* Applications in each region have a single endpoint to connect with

## Local account sign-in use cases

The following use cases are typical in a global Azure AD B2C environment. The local account use cases also cover accounts where the user travels. We provide a diagram and workflow steps for each use case.

### Local user sign-up

This use case demonstrates how a user from their home country/region performs a sign-up with an Azure AD B2C Local Account.

![Screenshot shows the Local user sign-up flow.](media/b2c-global-identity-funnel-based-design/local-user-account-signup.png)

1. A user from Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) attempts to sign up at **myapp.fr**. If the user isn't being sent to their local application instance, the traffic manager enforces a redirect.

1. The user reaches the Global Funnel Azure AD B2C tenant. This tenant is configured to redirect to a regional Azure AD B2C tenant based on defined criteria using OpenId federation. This can be a lookup based on Application clientId.

1. The user attempts to sign up. The sign-up process checks the global lookup table to determine if the user exists in any of the regional Azure AD B2C tenants.

1. The user isn't found in the global lookup table. The user's account is written into Azure AD B2C, and a record is created into the global lookup table to track the region in which the user signed-up.

1. The regional tenant issues a token back to the funnel tenant.

1. The funnel tenant issues a token to the application.

### Existing local user attempts sign up

This use case demonstrates how a user re-registering the same email from their own country/region, or a different region, is blocked.

### Account linking with matching criteria

This use case demonstrates how users are able to perform account linking when matching criteria is satisfied. The matching criteria is typically the users email address. When the matching criteria of a sign in from a new identity provider has the same value for an existing account in Azure AD B2C, the account linking process can begin.

![Screenshot shows the flow to merge a federated account.](media/b2c-global-identity-funnel-based-design/local-federated-account-merge.png)

1. A user from EMEA attempts to sign in at **myapp.fr**. If the user isn't being sent to their local application instance, the traffic manager enforces a redirect.

1. The user selects to sign in with a federated identity provider/social IdP.

1. A lookup is performed into the global lookup table for the ID returned from the federated IdP.

1. Where the ID doesn't exist, but the email from the federated IdP does exist in EMEA Azure AD B2C – this is an account linking use case.

1. Read the user from the directory and determine which authentication methods are enabled on the account. Present a screen for the user to sign in with an existing authentication method on this account.

1. Once the user proves they own the account in Azure AD B2C, add the new social ID to the existing account, and add the social ID to the account in the global lookup table.

1. The regional tenant issues a token back to the funnel tenant.

1. The funnel tenant issues a token to the application.  

### Traveling user account linking with matching criteria

This use case demonstrates how nonlocal users are able to perform account linking when matching criteria is satisfied. The matching criteria is typically the users email address. When the matching criteria of a sign in from a new identity provider has the same value for an existing account in Azure AD B2C, the account linking process can begin.

1. Create an id_token_hint link asserting the users currently collected claims. Bootstrap a journey into the NOAM Azure AD B2C tenant using federation. The user proves that they own the account via the NOAM Azure AD B2C tenant.
   >[!NOTE]
   >This method is used to re-use existing account linking logic in the home tenant and reduce external API calls to manipulate the identities collection. A custom policy sample which utilizes id_token_hint can be found [here](https://github.com/azure-ad-b2c/samples/tree/master/policies/invite).

1. Once the user proves they own the account in Azure AD B2C, add the new social ID to the existing account by making a Graph API call to the NOAM Azure AD B2C tenant. Add the social ID to the account in the global lookup table.

1. The regional tenant issues a token back to the funnel tenant.

1. The funnel tenant issues a token to the application.
