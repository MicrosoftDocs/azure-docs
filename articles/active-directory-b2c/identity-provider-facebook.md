## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-customization-prerequisites](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-customization-prerequisites.md)]

## Create a Facebook application

To enable sign-in for users with a Facebook account in Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), you need to create an application in [Facebook App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/). For more information, see [App Development](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development).

If you don't already have a Facebook account, sign up at [https://www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com). After you sign-up or sign-in with your Facebook account, start the [Facebook developer account registration process](https://developers.facebook.com/async/registration). For more information, see [Register as a Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register).

1. Sign in to [Facebook for developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) with your Facebook developer account credentials.
1. Select **Create App**.
1. For the **Select an app type**, select **Consumer**, then select **Next**.
1. Enter an **App Display Name** and a valid **App Contact Email**.
1. Select **Create App**. This step may require you to accept Facebook platform policies and complete an online security check.
1. Select **Settings** > **Basic**.
    1. Copy the value of **App ID**.
    1. Select **Show** and copy the value of **App Secret**. You use both of them to configure Facebook as an identity provider in your tenant. **App Secret** is an important security credential.
    1. Enter a URL for the **Privacy Policy URL**, for example `https://www.contoso.com/privacy`. The policy URL is a page you maintain to provide privacy information for your application.
    1. Enter a URL for the **Terms of Service URL**, for example `https://www.contoso.com/tos`. The policy URL is a page you maintain to provide terms and conditions for your application.
    1. Enter a URL for the **User Data Deletion**, for example `https://www.contoso.com/delete_my_data`. The User Data Deletion URL is a page you maintain to provide away for users to request that their data be deleted. 
    1. Choose a **Category**, for example `Business and Pages`. This value is required by Facebook, but not used for Azure AD B2C.
1. At the bottom of the page, select **Add Platform**, and then select **Website**.
1. In **Site URL**, enter the address of your website, for example `https://contoso.com`. 
1. Select **Save Changes**.
1. From the menu, select the **plus** sign or **Add Product** link next to **PRODUCTS**. Under the **Add Products to Your App**, select **Set up** under **Facebook Login**.
1. From the menu, select **Facebook Login**, select **Settings**.
1. In **Valid OAuth redirect URIs**, enter `https://your-tenant-name.b2clogin.com/your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`. If you use a [custom domain](custom-domain.md), enter `https://your-domain-name/your-tenant-id.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`. Replace `your-tenant-id` with the id of your tenant, and `your-domain-name` with your custom domain. 
1. Select **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page.
1. To make your Facebook application available to Azure AD B2C, select the Status selector at the top right of the page and turn it **On** to make the Application public, and then select **Switch Mode**. At this point, the Status should change from **Development** to **Live**. For more information, see [Facebook App Development](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release).

## Configure Facebook as an identity provider

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with an account that has at least [External Identity Provider Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#external-identity-provider-administrator) privileges.
1. 1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Azure AD B2C tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Select **Identity providers**, then select **Facebook**.
1. Enter a **Name**. For example, *Facebook*.
1. For the **Client ID**, enter the App ID of the Facebook application that you created earlier.
1. For the **Client secret**, enter the App Secret that you recorded.
1. Select **Save**.

## Add Facebook identity provider to a user flow 

At this point, the Facebook identity provider has been set up, but it's not yet available in any of the sign-in pages. To add the Facebook identity provider to a user flow:

1. In your Azure AD B2C tenant, select **User flows**.
1. Click the user flow that you want to add the Facebook identity provider.
1. Under the **Social identity providers**, select **Facebook**.
1. Select **Save**.
1. To test your policy, select **Run user flow**.
1. For **Application**, select the web application named *testapp1* that you previously registered. The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.
1. Select the **Run user flow** button.
1. From the sign-up or sign-in page, select **Facebook** to sign in with Facebook account.

If the sign-in process is successful, your browser is redirected to `https://jwt.ms`, which displays the contents of the token returned by Azure AD B2C.

## Create a policy key

You need to store the App Secret that you previously recorded in your Azure AD B2C tenant.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Azure AD B2C tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. On the Overview page, select **Identity Experience Framework**.
1. Select **Policy Keys** and then select **Add**.
1. For **Options**, choose `Manual`.
1. Enter a **Name** for the policy key. For example, `FacebookSecret`. The prefix `B2C_1A_` is added automatically to the name of your key.
1. In **Secret**, enter your App Secret that you previously recorded.
1. For **Key usage**, select `Signature`.
1. Click **Create**.

## Configure a Facebook account as an identity provider

1. In the `SocialAndLocalAccounts/`**`TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml`** file, replace the value of `client_id` with the Facebook application ID:

   ```xml
   <TechnicalProfile Id="Facebook-OAUTH">
     <Metadata>
     <!--Replace the value of client_id in this technical profile with the Facebook app ID"-->
       <Item Key="client_id">00000000000000</Item>
   ```

## Upload and test the policy

Update the relying party (RP) file that initiates the user journey that you created.

1. Upload the *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml* file to your tenant.
1. Under **Custom policies**, select **B2C_1A_signup_signin**.
1. For **Select Application**, select the web application named *testapp1* that you previously registered. The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.
1. Select the **Run now** button.
1. From the sign-up or sign-in page, select **Facebook** to sign in with Facebook account.

If the sign-in process is successful, your browser is redirected to `https://jwt.ms`, which displays the contents of the token returned by Azure AD B2C.
