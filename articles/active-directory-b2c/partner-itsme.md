#Customer intent: As a developer integrating Azure AD B2C authentication with itsme OpenID Connect (OIDC), I want to configure the itsme Identity Provider in Azure AD B2C, so that users can sign in securely using their itsme digital ID app without the need for passwords or multiple PIN codes.

# Configure itsme OpenID Connect (OIDC) with Azure Active Directory B2C

The itsme digital ID app allows you to sign in securely without card-readers, passwords, two-factor authentication, or multiple PIN codes. The itsme app provides strong customer authentication with a verified identity. In this article, learn how to integrate Azure AD B2C authentication with itsme OpenID Connect (OIDC) using a client secret user flow policy.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* [An Azure AD B2C tenant](tutorial-create-tenant.md) that is linked to your Azure subscription.
* Your Client ID, also known as Partner code, provided by itsme.
* Your Service code provided by itsme.
* Your client secret for your itsme account.

## Scenario description

<!--
Please clarify step 1 in the description below - we don't have steps in this tutorial for "adapting in the Azure AD B2C Custom Policy- User Journeys" - should this be added somewhere?
-->

| Step | Description |
|------|------|
|1     | On your website or application, include the **Log in with itsme** button by adapting in the Azure AD B2C user flow. The interaction flow starts when the user clicks on this button.  |
|2     | Azure AD B2C starts the OpenID connect flow by sending an Authorize request to the itsme client secret API. A well-known/OpenID-configuration endpoint is available containing information about the endpoints.  |
|3     | The itsme environment redirects the user to the itsme identify yourself page, allowing the user to fill in their phone number.  |
|4     | The itsme environment receives the phone number from the user and validates the correctness.  |
|5     | If the phone number belongs to an active itsme user, an Action is created for the itsme app.  |
|6     | The user opens the itsme app, checks the request, and confirms the action.  |
|7     |  The app informs the itsme environment the action has been confirmed. |
|8     |  The itsme environment returns the OAuth authorize code to Azure AD B2C. |
|9     |  Using the authorize code, the Azure AD B2C does a token request. |
| 10 | The itsme environment checks the token request, and if still valid, returns the OAuth access token and the ID token containing the requested user information. |
| 11 | Finally, the user is redirected to the redirect URL as an authenticated user.  |
|   |   |

## Onboard with itsme

1. To create an account with itsme, visit itsme at the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace).

1. Activate your itsme account by sending an email to onboarding@itsme.be. You'll receive a **Partner code** and **Service code** that will be needed for your B2C setup.

1. After activation of your itsme partner account, you'll receive an email with a one-time link to the **client secret**.

1. Follow the instructions at [itsme](https://www.itsme-id.com/en-BE/business) to complete the configuration.

## Integrate with Azure AD B2C

### Set up a new Identity Provider in Azure AD B2C

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have one already, [create an Azure AD B2C tenant](tutorial-create-tenant.md) that is linked to your Azure subscription.

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Azure AD B2C tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Under **Azure services**, select **Azure AD B2C** (or select **More services** and use the **All services** search box to search for *Azure AD B2C*).
1. Select **Identity providers**, and then select **New OpenID Connect provider**.
1. Fill in the form with the following information:

   |Property | Value |
   |------------ |------- |
   | Name | itsme |
   | Metadata URL | `https://oidc.<environment>.itsme.services/clientsecret-oidc/csapi/v0.1/.well-known/openid-configuration` <br>where `<environment>` is either `e2e` (test environment) or `prd` (production)  |
   | ClientID     | Your **Client ID**, also known as **Partner code**  |
   | Client Secret | Your **client_secret** |
   | Scope  | openid service:YOURSERVICECODE profile email [phone] [address]  |
   |Response Type | code |
   |Response Mode | query |
   |Domain Hint | *You can leave this empty* |
   |UserID | sub |
   |Display Name | name |
   |Given name | given_name |
   |Surname | family_name |
   |Email | email|

1. Select **Save**.

### Configure a User Flow

1. In your Azure AD B2C tenant, under **Policies**, select **User flows**.

1. Select **New user flow**.

1. Select **Sign up and sign in**, select a version, and then select **Create**.

1. Enter a **Name**.

1. In the **Identity providers** section, select **itsme**.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Open the newly created user flow by selecting the user flow name.

1. Select **Properties** and adjust the following values:

   * Change **Access & ID token lifetimes (minutes)** to **5**.
   * Change **Refresh token sliding window lifetime** to **No expiry**.

### Register an application

1. In your B2C tenant, under **Manage**, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.

1. Provide a **Name** for the application and enter your **Redirect URI**. For testing purposes, enter `https://jwt.ms`.

1. Make sure multi-factor authentication is **Disabled**.

1. Select **Register**.

To use this app registration to test the user flow, you need to enable implicit grant flow: 

1. Select the app registration you created.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication**.

1. Under **Implicit grant and hybrid flows**, select both the **Access tokens (used for implicit flows)** and **ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows)** check boxes.

1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you enable implicit grant to test a user flow, make sure you disable the implicit grant flow settings before you deploy your app to production.

## Test the user flow

1. In your B2C tenant, under **Policies** select **User flows**.

1. Select your previously created user flow.

1. Select **Run user flow**.

   a. For **Application**, select the app that you registered.

   b. For **Reply URL**, select the redirect URL that you added to your app. For testing purposes, select `https://jwt.ms`.

1. The itsme **Identify yourself** page appears.  

1. Enter your mobile phone number and select **send**.

1. Confirm the action in the itsme app.
