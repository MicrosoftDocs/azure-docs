# Register apps in Azure Active Directory B2C

Before your [applications](application-types.md) can interact with Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), you must register them in a tenant that you manage.

Azure AD B2C supports authentication for various modern application architectures. The interaction of every application type with Azure AD B2C is different. Hence, you need to specify the type of app that you want to register. 


## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

- If you haven't already created your own [Azure AD B2C Tenant](tutorial-create-tenant.md), create one now. You can use an existing Azure AD B2C tenant.


## Select an app type to register

You can register different app types in your Azure AD B2C Tenant. The how-to guides below show you how to register and configure the various app types:


- [Single-page application (SPA)](tutorial-register-spa.md)
- [Web application](tutorial-register-applications.md)
- [Native client (for mobile and desktop)](add-native-application.md)
- [Web API](add-web-api-application.md) 
- [Daemon apps](client-credentials-grant-flow.md)
- [Microsoft Graph application](microsoft-graph-get-started.md)
- [SAML application](saml-service-provider.md?tabs=windows&pivots=b2c-custom-policy)
- [Publish app in Microsoft Entra app gallery](publish-app-to-azure-ad-app-gallery.md)
