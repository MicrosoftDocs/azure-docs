#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to create an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant, link it to my subscription, switch to the directory, and add the Azure AD B2C resource as a favorite in the Azure portal, so that I can manage and configure my applications to interact with Azure AD B2C.

# Tutorial: Create an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant

Before your applications can interact with Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), they must be registered in a tenant that you manage. 

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure AD B2C tenant
> * Link your tenant to your subscription
> * Switch to the directory containing your Azure AD B2C tenant
> * Add the Azure AD B2C resource as a **Favorite** in the Azure portal

Before you create your Azure AD B2C tenant, you need to take the following considerations into account: 

- You can create up to **20** tenants per subscription. This limit help protect against threats to your resources, such as denial-of-service attacks, and is enforced in both the Azure portal and the underlying tenant creation API. If you want to increase this limit, please contact [Microsoft Support](find-help-open-support-ticket.md). 

- By default, each tenant can accommodate a total of **1.25 million** objects (user accounts and applications), but you can increase this limit to **5.25 million** objects when you add and verify a custom domain. If you want to increase this limit, please contact [Microsoft Support](find-help-open-support-ticket.md). However, if you created your tenant before **September 2022**, this limit doesn't affect you, and your tenant will retain the size allocated to it at creation, that's, **50 million** objects. Learn how to [read your tenant usage](microsoft-graph-operations.md#tenant-usage).  

- If you want to reuse a tenant name that you previously tried to delete, but you see the error "Already in use by another directory" when you enter the domain name, you'll need to [follow these steps to fully delete the tenant](./faq.yml?tabs=app-reg-ga#how-do-i-delete-my-azure-ad-b2c-tenant-) before you try again. You require a role of at least *Subscription Administrator*. After deleting the tenant, you might also need to sign out and sign back in before you can reuse the domain name.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

- An Azure account that's been assigned at least the [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) role within the subscription or a resource group within the subscription is required.

## Create an Azure AD B2C tenant
>[!NOTE]
>If you're unable to create Azure AD B2C tenant, [review your user settings page](tenant-management-check-tenant-creation-permission.md) to ensure that tenant creation isn't switched off. If tenant creation is switched on, ask your [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator) to assign you a [Tenant Creator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#tenant-creator) role.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 

1. Make sure you're using the Microsoft Entra tenant that contains your subscription: 

    1. In the Azure portal toolbar, select the **Directories + subscriptions** icon.
    
    1. On the **Portal settings | Directories + subscriptions** page, find your Microsoft Entra directory that contains your subscription in the **Directory name** list, and then select **Switch** button next to it.
        
        ![Screenshot of the directories and subscriptions window.](media/tutorial-create-tenant/switch-directory.png)

1. Add **Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory** as a resource provider for the Azure subscription you're using ([learn more](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#register-resource-provider-1)):

    1. On the Azure portal, search for and select **Subscriptions**.
    1. Select your subscription, and then in the left menu, select **Resource providers**. If you don't see the left menu, select the **Show the menu for < name of your subscription >** icon at the top left part of the page to expand it.
    1. Make sure the **Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory** row shows a status of **Registered**. If it doesn't, select the row, and then select **Register**.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**.

   ![Select the Create a resource button](media/tutorial-create-tenant/create-a-resource.png)

1. Search for **Azure Active Directory B2C**, and then select **Create**.

1. Select **Create a new Azure AD B2C Tenant**.

    ![Create a new Azure AD B2C tenant selected in Azure portal](media/tutorial-create-tenant/portal-02-create-tenant.png)

1. On the **Create a directory** page:

   - For **Organization name**, enter a name for your Azure AD B2C tenant.
   - For **Initial domain name**, enter a domain name for your Azure AD B2C tenant.
   - For **Location**, select your country/region from the list. If the country/region you select has a [Go-Local add-on](data-residency.md#go-local-add-on) option, such as Japan or Australia, and you want to store your data exclusively within that country/region, select the **Store Microsoft Entra Core Store data and Microsoft Entra components and service data in the location selected above** checkbox. Go-Local add-on is a paid add-on whose charge is added to your Azure AD B2C Premium P1 or P2 licenses charges, see [Billing model](billing.md#about-go-local-add-on). You can't change the data residency region after you create your Azure AD B2C tenant. 
   - For **Subscription**, select your subscription from the list.
   - For **Resource group**, select or search for the resource group that will contain the tenant.

1. Select **Review + create**.
1. Review your directory settings. Then select **Create**. Learn more about [troubleshooting deployment errors](../azure-resource-manager/troubleshooting/common-deployment-errors.md).

You can link multiple Azure AD B2C tenants to a single Azure subscription for billing purposes. To link a tenant, you must be an admin in the Azure AD B2C tenant and be assigned at least a Contributor role within the Azure subscription. See [Link an Azure AD B2C tenant to a subscription](billing.md#link-an-azure-ad-b2c-tenant-to-a-subscription).

> [!NOTE]
> When an Azure AD B2C directory is created, an application called `b2c-extensions-app`  is automatically created inside the new directory. Do not modify or delete it. The application is used by Azure AD B2C for storing user data. Learn more about [Azure AD B2C: Extensions app](extensions-app.md).

## Activate Azure AD B2C Go-Local add-on

Azure AD B2C allows you to activate Go-Local add-on on an existing tenant as long as your tenant stores data in a country/region that has local data residence option. To opt in to Go-Local add-on, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Azure AD B2C tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
    
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.

1. On the tenant management page that appears, on the top of the page, select **Enable data residency** link.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-create-tenant/opt-in-go-local-add-on.png" alt-text="Screenshot of opt in to Azure AD B2C Go-Local add-on in Azure portal."::: 

1. On the **Data residency** pane that appears, select the **Store my directory and Microsoft Entra data in \<Country\>** checkbox, then select **Save** button.

1. Close the **Data residency** pane. 

## Select your B2C tenant directory

To start using your new Azure AD B2C tenant, you need to switch to the directory that contains the tenant:
1. In the Azure portal toolbar, select the **Directories + subscriptions** filter icon.
1. On the **All Directories** tab, find the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant and then select the **Switch** button next to it.

If at first you don't see your new Azure B2C tenant in the list, refresh your browser window or sign out and sign back in. Then in the Azure portal toolbar, select the **Directories + subscriptions** filter again.


## Add Azure AD B2C as a favorite (optional)

This optional step makes it easier to select your Azure AD B2C tenant in the following and all subsequent tutorials.

Instead of searching for *Azure AD B2C* in **All services** every time you want to work with your tenant, you can instead favorite the resource. Then, you can select it from the portal menu's **Favorites** section to quickly browse to your Azure AD B2C tenant.

You only need to perform this operation once. Before performing these steps, make sure you've switched to the directory containing your Azure AD B2C tenant as described in the previous section, [Select your B2C tenant directory](#select-your-b2c-tenant-directory).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the Azure portal menu, select **All services**.
1. In the **All services** search box, search for **Azure AD B2C**, hover over the search result, and then select the star icon in the tooltip. **Azure AD B2C** now appears in the Azure portal under **Favorites**.
1. If you want to change the position of your new favorite, go to the Azure portal menu, select **Azure AD B2C**, and then drag it up or down to the desired position.
