# Configure TheAccessHub Admin Tool with Azure Active Directory B2C

In this tutorial, learn how to integrate Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) with [TheAccessHub Admin Tool](https://n8identity.com/products/theaccesshub-admintool/) from N8 Identity [N8ID](https://n8identity.com/). The solution addresses customer account migration and customer service request (CSR) administration.  

Use this solution for the following scenarios:

- You have a site and want to migrate to Azure AD B2C. 
  - However, customer-account migration is challenging, including passwords.
- You need a CSR tool to administer Azure AD B2C accounts.
- Delegated CSR administration is a requirement.
- You want to synchronize and merge data from repositories into Azure AD B2C.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need:

* An Azure subscription

  - If you don't have a one, you can get an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- An [Azure AD B2C tenant](./tutorial-create-tenant.md) linked to your Azure subscription
- TheAccessHub Admin Tool environment
  - See, [N8 Identity/contact](https://n8identity.com/contact/) for a new environment
- Optional: 
  - Connection and credential information for databases or Lightweight Directory Access Protocols (LDAPs), from which you want to migrate customer data
  - A configured Azure AD B2C environment for [custom policies](./tutorial-create-user-flows.md?pivots=b2c-custom-policy) to integrate TheAccessHub Admin Tool into your sign-up policy flow

## Scenario description

The TheAccessHub Admin Tool runs in the N8ID Azure subscription or the customer subscription. The following architecture diagram shows the implementation.

   ![Diagram of the n8identity architecture.](./media/partner-n8identity/n8identity-architecture-diagram.png)

1. User arrives on a sign-in page, creates an account, and enters information. Azure AD B2C collects user attributes.
2. Azure AD B2C calls the TheAccessHub Admin Tool and passes the user attributes.
3. TheAccessHub Admin Tool checks your database for current user information.  
4. User records synchronize from the database to TheAccessHub Admin Tool.
5. TheAccessHub Admin Tool shares the data with the delegated CSR or helpdesk admin.
6. TheAccessHub Admin Tool syncs user records with Azure AD B2C.
7. Based on TheAccessHub Admin Tool response, Azure AD B2C sends a customized welcome email to users.

## Create an External Identity Provider Administrator and B2C User Flow Administrator in your Azure AD B2C tenant

TheAccessHub Admin Tool permissions act on behalf of an External Identity Provider Administrator and B2C User Flow Administrator to read user information and conduct changes in your Azure AD B2C tenant. Changes to your regular administrators don't affect TheAccessHub Admin Tool interaction with the tenant.

To create an External Identity Provider Administrator and B2C User Flow Administrator:

1. In the Azure portal, sign in to your Azure AD B2C tenant as an Administrator. 
2. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Users**.
3. Select **New User**.
4. Choose **Create User** to create a regular directory user and not a customer.
5. On the identity information form:
* Enter the **username**, such as theaccesshub.
* Enter the **account name**, such as TheAccessHub Service Account.
7. Select **Show Password**.
8. Copy and save the initial password.
9. To assign the External Identity Provider Administrator and B2C User Flow Administrator role, for **User**, select the user's current role.
10. Select the **External Identity Provider Administrator** and **B2C User Flow Administrator** records.
11. Select **Create**.

## Connect TheAccessHub Admin Tool to your Azure AD B2C tenant

TheAccessHub Admin Tool uses the Microsoft Graph API to read and make changes to a directory. It acts as an External Identity Provider Administrator and B2C User Flow Administrator in your tenant. Use the following instructions to add needed permissions. 

To authorize TheAccessHub Admin Tool to access your directory:

1. Use the credentials N8 Identity provided to sign in to TheAccessHub Admin Tool.
2. Go to **System Admin** > **Azure AD B2C Config**.
3. Select **Authorize Connection**.
4. In the new window, sign in with your External Identity Provider Administrator and B2C User Flow Administrator account. When you sign in for the first time with the new service account, a prompt to reset your password can appear.
5. Follow the prompts and select **Accept**.

## Configure a new CSR user with your enterprise identity

Create a CSR or Helpdesk user who accesses TheAccessHub Admin Tool with enterprise Microsoft Entra credentials.

1. Use the credentials N8 Identity provided to sign in to TheAccessHub Admin Tool.
2. Go to **Manager Tools** > **Manage Colleagues**.
3. Select **Add Colleague**.
4. For **Colleague Type**, select **Azure Administrator**.
5. For the profile information, select a home organization to control who has permission to manage this user.
6. For **Login ID/Azure AD User Name**, enter the user principal name from the user Microsoft Entra account.
7. On the **TheAccessHub Roles** tab, select the **Helpdesk** managed role. 
6. Select **Submit**.

> [!NOTE]
> The Helpdesk role provides access to the **Manage Colleagues** view. Place the user into a group or make them an organization owner.

## Configure a new CSR user with a new identity

Create a CSR or Helpdesk user to access TheAccessHub Admin Tool with a new local credential. This user is for organizations that don't use Microsoft Entra ID.

See, [The AccessHub Admin Tool: Add Colleague Administrator](https://youtu.be/iOpOI2OpnLI) without SSO.

1. Use the credentials N8ID provided to sign in to TheAccessHub Admin Tool.
2. Go to **Manager Tools** > **Manage Colleagues**.
3. Select **Add Colleague**.

1. Use the credentials N8ID provided to sign in to TheAccessHub Admin Tool.
2. Go to **Organization > Manage Groups**.
3. Select **Add Group**.
4. Enter values for **Group name**, **Group description**, and **Group owner**.
5. Search for and select the boxes for colleagues to be members of the group.
6. Select **Add**.
7. Group members appear at the bottom of the page. Select the **X** on a row to remove a member.
8. Select **Submit**.

### Create a new organization

1. Use the credentials N8ID provided to sign in to TheAccessHub Admin Tool.
2. Go to **Organization** > **Manage Organizations**.'
3. Select **Add Organization**.
4. Enter values for **Organization name**, **Organization owner**, and **Parent organization**
5. Select **Submit**.

> [!NOTE]
> Align the organization name with customer data. When loading colleague and customer data, and you enter the organization name in the load, the colleague appears in the organization. The owner manages customers and colleagues in the organization and suborganizations. The parent organization is responsible for the organization.

### Modify the hierarchy via the tree view

Use this function to visualize colleague and group management.

1. Use the credentials N8ID provided to sign in to TheAccessHub Admin Tool.
2. Go to **Manager Tools** > **Tree View**.
3. To modify the hierarchy, drag organizations into parent organizations.
4. Select **Save**.

## Customize the welcome notification

If you're using TheAccessHub Admin Tool to migrate users from one solution into Azure AD B2C, you can customize the user welcome notification. The notification goes to users during migration and can include a link to set a new password in the Azure AD B2C directory.

To customize the notification:

1. Use the credentials N8ID provided to sign in to TheAccessHub Admin Tool.
2. Go to **System Admin** > **Notifications**.
