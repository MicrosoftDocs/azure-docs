# Azure AD B2C Preview: Calling a web API from a .NET web app

<!-- TODO [AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-switcher](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-switcher.md)]-->

With Azure AD B2C, you can add powerful self-service identity managment features to your web apps and web apis in a few short steps.  This article will show you how
to create a .NET MVC "To-Do List" web app that calls a 	.NET web API using OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens.  Both the web app and web api use Azure AD B2C to manage user identities
and authenticate users.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-preview-note](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-preview-note.md)]

This article does not cover how to implement sign-in, sign-up and profile management with Azure AD B2C.  It focuses on calling web APIs after the user is already authenticated.
If you haven't already, you should start with the [.NET Web App getting started tutorial](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-dotnet.md) to learn about the basics of Azure AD B2C.

## 1. Get an Azure AD B2C directory

Before you can use Azure AD B2C, you must create a directory, or tenant.  A directory is a container for all your users, apps, groups, and so on.  If you don't have
one already, go [create a B2C directory](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md) before moving on.

## 2. Create an application

Now you need to create an app in your B2C directory, which gives Azure AD some information that it needs to securely communicate with your app.  Both the web app and
web API will be represented by a single **Application ID** in this case, since they comprise one logical app.  To create an app,
follow [these instructions](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md).  Be sure to

- Include a **web app/web api** in the application
- Enter `https://localhost:44316/` as a **Reply URL** - it is the default URL for this code sample.
- Create an **Application Secret** for your application and copy it down.  You will need it shortly.
- Copy down the **Application ID** that is assigned to your app.  You will also need it shortly.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps.md)]

## 3. Create your policies

In Azure AD B2C, every user experience is defined by a [**policy**](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md).  This web app contains three 
identity experiences - sign-up, sign-in, and edit profile.  You will need to create one policy of each type, as described in the 
[policy reference article](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md#how-to-create-a-sign-up-policy).  When creating your three policies, be sure to:

- Choose the **Display Name** and a few other sign-up attributes in your sign-up policy.
- Choose the **Display Name** and **Object ID** application claims in every policy.  You can choose other claims as well.
- Copy down the **Name** of each policy after you create it.  It should have the prefix `b2c_1_`.  You'll need those policy names shortly.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-policy](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-policy.md)] 

Once you have your three policies successfully created, you're ready to build your app.

Note that this article does not cover how to use the policies you just created.  If you want to learn about how policies work in Azure AD B2C,
you should start with the [.NET Web App getting started tutorial](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-dotnet.md).

## 4. Download the code

The code for this tutorial is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet).  To build the sample as you go, you can 
[download a skeleton project as a .zip](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet/archive/skeleton.zip) or clone the skeleton:

```
git clone --branch skeleton https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet.git
```

The completed app is also [available as a .zip](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet/archive/complete.zip) or on the
`complete` branch of the same repo.

Once you've downloaded the sample code, open the Visual Studio `.sln` file to get started.  You'll notice that there are two projects in the solution: a `TaskWebApp` project and a `TaskService` project.  The `TaskWebApp` is the WPF 
web app front end that the user interacts with.  The `TaskService` is the app's backend web API that stores each user's to-do list. 

## 5. Configure the task service

When the `TaskService` receieves requests from the `TaskWebApp`, it checks for a valid access token to authenticate the request.  In order to validate the access token, 
you need to provide the `TaskService` with some information about your app.  In the `TaskService` project, open up the `web.config` file in the root 
of the project and replace the values in the `<appSettings>` section:

```
<appSettings>
    <add key="webpages:Version" value="3.0.0.0" />
    <add key="webpages:Enabled" value="false" />
    <add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="ida:AadInstance" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}/{1}/{2}?p={3}" />
    <add key="ida:Tenant" value="{Enter the name of your B2C tenant - it usually looks like constoso.onmicrosoft.com}" />
    <add key="ida:ClientId" value="{Enter the Application ID assigned to your app by the Azure Portal}" />
    <add key="ida:PolicyId" value="{Enter the name of one of the policies you created, like `b2c_1_my_sign_in_policy`}" />
</appSettings>
```
  
[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name.md)]


This article will not cover the details of securing the `TaskService`.  If you want to learn how a web API securely authenticates requests using Azure AD B2C, check out our
[Web API Getting Started article](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-api-dotnet.md).

## 6. Configure the task web app

In order for the `TaskWebApp` to communicate with Azure AD B2C, there are a few common parameters that you will need to provide.  In the `TaskWebApp` project, open up the
`web.config` file in the root of the project and replace the values in the `<appSettings>` section.  These values will be used throughout the web app.

```
<appSettings>
    <add key="webpages:Version" value="3.0.0.0" />
    <add key="webpages:Enabled" value="false" />
    <add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="ida:Tenant" value="{Enter the name of your B2C directory, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com}" />
    <add key="ida:ClientId" value="{Enter the Application Id assinged to your app by the Azure portal, e.g.580e250c-8f26-49d0-bee8-1c078add1609}" />
    <add key="ida:ClientSecret" value="{Enter the Application Secret you created in the Azure portal, e.g. yGNYWwypRS4Sj1oYXd0443n}" />
    <add key="ida:AadInstance" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}{1}{2}" />
    <add key="ida:RedirectUri" value="https://localhost:44316/" />
    <add key="ida:SignUpPolicyId" value="[Enter your sign up policy name, e.g.g b2c_1_sign_up" />
    <add key="ida:SignInPolicyId" value="[Enter your sign in policy name, e.g. b2c_1_sign_in]" />
    <add key="ida:UserProfilePolicyId" value="[Enter your edit profile policy name, e.g. b2c_1_profile_edit" />
    <add key="api:TaskServiceUrl" value="https://localhost:44332/" />
</appSettings>
```     

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name.md)]

There are also two `[PolicyAuthorize]` decorators in which you need to provide your sign-in policy name.  The `[PolicyAuthorize]` attribute is used to invoke a particular
policy when the user attempts to access a page in the app that requires authentication.

```C#
// Controllers\HomeController.cs

[PolicyAuthorize(Policy = "{Enter the name of your sign in policy, e.g. b2c_1_my_sign_in}")]
public ActionResult Claims()
{
```

```C#
// Controllers\TasksController.cs

[PolicyAuthorize(Policy = "{Enter the name of your sign in policy, e.g. b2c_1_my_sign_in}")]
public class TasksController : Controller
{
```

## 7. Get access tokens and call the task API

This section will show how to complete an OAuth 2.0 token exchange in a web app using Microsoft's libraries and frameworks.  If you are
unfamiliar with **authorization codes** and **access tokens**, it may be a good idea to skim through the [OpenID Connect protocol reference](active-directory-b2c-reference-protocols.md).

#### Get an authorization code

The first step in calling the `TaskService` web API is to authenticate the user and receive an **authorization code** from Azure AD.
You can receive an authorization code from Azure AD after any policy is executed successfully, including sign-in, sign-up, and edit profile policies.

To start, install the OWIN OpenID Connect middleware using the Visual Studio Package Manager Console. We'll use OWIN to send authentication
request to Azure AD and handle their responses:

```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect -ProjectName TaskWebApp
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies -ProjectName TaskWebApp
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb -ProjectName TaskWebApp
```

Open the file `App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`.  This is where we'll configure the OWIN authentication pipeline, providing the details of your B2C directory
and the application you created:

```C#
// App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs

public partial class Startup
{
	public const string AcrClaimType = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnclassreference";
	public const string PolicyKey = "b2cpolicy";
	public const string OIDCMetadataSuffix = "/.well-known/openid-configuration";

	// App config settings
	public static string clientId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ClientId"];
	public static string clientSecret = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ClientSecret"];
	public static string aadInstance = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:AadInstance"];
	public static string tenant = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Tenant"];
	public static string redirectUri = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:RedirectUri"];

	// B2C policy identifiers
	public static string SignUpPolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignUpPolicyId"];
	public static string SignInPolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignInPolicyId"];
	public static string ProfilePolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:UserProfilePolicyId"];

	public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)
	{
		app.SetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);

		app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions());

		OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions options = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
		{
			// These are standard OpenID Connect parameters, with values pulled from web.config
			ClientId = clientId,
			RedirectUri = redirectUri,
			PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,
			Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications
			{
				AuthenticationFailed = OnAuthenticationFailed,
				RedirectToIdentityProvider = OnRedirectToIdentityProvider,
				AuthorizationCodeReceived = OnAuthorizationCodeReceived,
			},
			Scope = "openid offline_access",

			// The PolicyConfigurationManager takes care of getting the correct Azure AD authentication
			// endpoints from the OpenID Connect metadata endpoint.  It is included in the PolicyAuthHelpers folder.
			ConfigurationManager = new PolicyConfigurationManager(
				String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, tenant, "/v2.0", OIDCMetadataSuffix),
				new string[] { SignUpPolicyId, SignInPolicyId, ProfilePolicyId }),

			// This piece is optional - it is used for displaying the user's name in the navigation bar.
			TokenValidationParameters = new System.IdentityModel.Tokens.TokenValidationParameters
			{
				NameClaimType = "name",
			},
		};

		app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(options);
	}
	...
}
```

#### Get an access token using the authorization code

Your web app is now configured to authenticate the user using your B2C directory, and receive back an authorization code from Azure AD.
The next step is to exchange this authorization code for an access token from Azure AD. 

Whenever your .NET web apps need to get access tokens from Azure AD, you can use the **Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)**.  
You don't have to use ADAL for this process, but ADAL makes it easier for you by taking care of many details, such as sending OAuth
2.0 authentication messages, caching, and refreshing tokens.

First, install ADAL into the `TaskWebApp` project using the Package Manager Console once more:

```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Experimental.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory -ProjectName TaskWebApp -IncludePrerelease
```

Now you need to pass the authorization code to ADAL so it can get tokens for you.  The OWIN OpenID Connect middleware provides a notification
for you to use this authorization code - the notification will be fired each time your app receives an authorization code from Azure AD.
In `App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`, implement the `OnAuthorizationCodeReceived` notification handler using ADAL:

```C#
// App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs

private async Task OnAuthorizationCodeReceived(AuthorizationCodeReceivedNotification notification)
{
	// The user's objectId is extracted from the claims provided in the id_token, and used to cache tokens in ADAL
	// The authority is constructed by appending your B2C directory's name to "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"
	// The client credential is where you provide your application secret, and is used to authenticate the application to Azure AD
	string userObjectID = notification.AuthenticationTicket.Identity.FindFirst("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier").Value;
	string authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, tenant, string.Empty, string.Empty);
	ClientCredential credential = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);

	// We don't care which policy is used to access the TaskService, so let's use the most recent policy as indicated in the sign-in token
	string mostRecentPolicy = notification.AuthenticationTicket.Identity.FindFirst(Startup.AcrClaimType).Value;

	// The Authentication Context is ADAL's primary class, which represents your connection to your B2C directory
	// ADAL uses an in-memory token cache by default.  In this case, we've extended the default cache to use a simple per-user session cache
	AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority, new NaiveSessionCache(userObjectID));

	// Here you ask for a token using the web app's clientId as the scope, since the web app and service share the same clientId.
	// The token will be stored in the ADAL token cache, for use in our controllers
	AuthenticationResult result = await authContext.AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCodeAsync(notification.Code, new Uri(redirectUri), credential, new string[] { clientId }, mostRecentPolicy);
}
``` 

#### Get an access token in the controllers

Now that we've acquired an access token for the `TaskService` backend and stored it in ADAL's token cache, we need to actually use it.
The `TasksController` is responsible for communicating with the `TaskService` API, and sends HTTP requests to the API to read, create,
and delete tasks.  Before sending an HTTP request, get an access token from ADAL:

```C#
// Controllers\TasksController.cs

public async Task<ActionResult> Index()
{
	AuthenticationResult result = null;
	try
	{
		string userObjectID = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier").Value;
		string authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, Startup.aadInstance, Startup.tenant, string.Empty, string.Empty);
		ClientCredential credential = new ClientCredential(Startup.clientId, Startup.clientSecret);

		// We don't care which policy is used to access the TaskService, so let's use the most recent policy
		string mostRecentPolicy = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(Startup.AcrClaimType).Value;
		
		// Here you ask for a token using the web app's clientId as the scope, since the web app and service share the same clientId.
		// AcquireTokenSilentAsync will return a token from the token cache, and throw an exception if it cannot do so.
		AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority, new NaiveSessionCache(userObjectID));
		result = await authContext.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(new string[] { Startup.clientId }, credential, UserIdentifier.AnyUser, mostRecentPolicy);

		...
	}
	catch (AdalException ee)
	{
		// If ADAL could not get a token silently, show the user an error indicating they might need to sign in again.
		return new RedirectResult("/Error?message=An Error Occurred Reading To Do List: " + ee.Message + " You might need to log out and log back in.");
	}
	...
}
``` 

ADAL will take care of caching the tokens, refreshing them when they expire, and telling you when the user must sign in again by throwing exceptions.  All
you need to do is to call `AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(...)` whenever you need a token in your app.

#### Read tasks from the web API

Now that you have a token, you can attach it to the HTTP GET request in the `Authorization` header to securely call the `TaskService`:

```C#
// Controllers\TasksController.cs

public async Task<ActionResult> Index()
{
	... 
	
	try 
	{
		HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
		HttpRequestMessage request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, serviceUrl + "/api/tasks");

		// Add the token acquired from ADAL to the request headers
		request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.Token);
		HttpResponseMessage response = await client.SendAsync(request);

		if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
		{
			String responseString = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
			JArray tasks = JArray.Parse(responseString);
			ViewBag.Tasks = tasks;
			return View();
		}
		else
		{
			// If the call failed with access denied, then drop the current access token from the cache, 
			// and show the user an error indicating they might need to sign-in again.
			if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)
			{
				var todoTokens = authContext.TokenCache.ReadItems().Where(a => a.Scope.Contains(Startup.clientId));
				foreach (TokenCacheItem tci in todoTokens)
					authContext.TokenCache.DeleteItem(tci);

				return new RedirectResult("/Error?message=Error: " + response.ReasonPhrase + " You might need to sign in again.");
			}
		}

		return new RedirectResult("/Error?message=An Error Occurred Reading To Do List: " + response.StatusCode);
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		return new RedirectResult("/Error?message=An Error Occurred Reading To Do List: " + ex.Message);
	}
}

```

#### Create & delete tasks on the web API

You can follow the same exact pattern in sending POST and DELETE requests to the `TaskService`.  Simply call `AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(...)`,
and attach the resulting token to the request in the `Authorization` header.  We've implemented the `Create` action for you.  Try finishing the `Delete` action in
`TasksController.cs` yourself.

## 8. Sign the user out

One final detail.  When the user signs out of the web app, you'll want to clear the ADAL token cache to remove any remnants of the user's authenticated session:

```C#
// Controllers/AccountController.cs

public void SignOut()
{
	if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
	{
		// When the user signs out, clear their token cache in the process
		string userObjectID = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier").Value;
		string authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, Startup.aadInstance, Startup.tenant, string.Empty, string.Empty);
		AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority, new NaiveSessionCache(userObjectID));
		authContext.TokenCache.Clear();

		HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.SignOut(
		new AuthenticationProperties(
			new Dictionary<string, string> 
			{ 
				{Startup.PolicyKey, ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(Startup.AcrClaimType).Value}
			}), OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType, CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
	}
}
```

## 9. Run the sample app

Finally, build and run both the `TaskClient` and the `TaskService`.  Sign up or sign into the app, and create tasks for the signed in user.  Sign out, and sign back in as a different user, creating tasks for that user.
Notice how the tasks are stored per-user on the API, since the API extracts the user's identity from the access token it receives.

For reference, the completed sample [is provided as a .zip here](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet/archive/complete.zip),
