#Customer intent: As an application developer or administrator using Azure Active Directory B2C, I want to enable age gating in my user flow, so that I can identify and manage minors accessing my application based on their age and consent status.

# Enable age gating in Azure Active Directory B2C

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-choose-user-flow-or-custom-policy](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-choose-user-flow-or-custom-policy.md)]

Age gating in Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) enables you to identify minors that want to use your application, with, or without parental consent. You can choose to block the minor from sign-in into the application. Or allow uses to complete the sign-in, and provide the application the minor status. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This feature is in public preview. Do not use feature for production applications.
>

When age gating is enabled for a user flow, users are asked for their date of birth, and country/region of residence. If a user signs in that hasn't previously entered the information, they'll need to enter it the next time they sign in. The rules are applied every time a user signs in.

Azure AD B2C uses the information that the user enters to identify whether they're a minor. The **ageGroup** field is then updated in their account. The value can be `null`, `Undefined`, `Minor`, `Adult`, and `NotAdult`.  The **ageGroup** and **consentProvidedForMinor** fields are then used to calculate the value of **legalAgeGroupClassification**.


## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-customization-prerequisites](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-customization-prerequisites.md)]

## Set up your tenant for age gating

To use age gating in a user flow, you need to configure your tenant to have extra properties.

1. Use [this link](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_AAD_B2CAdmin_agegatingenabled=true#blade/Microsoft_AAD_B2CAdmin/TenantManagementMenuBlade/overview) to try the age gating preview.
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Azure AD B2C tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Select **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Select **Properties** for your tenant in the menu on the left.
1. Under the **Age gating**, select **Configure**.
1. Wait for the operation to complete and your tenant will be set up for age gating.

## Enable age gating in your user flow

After your tenant is set up to use age gating, you can then use this feature in [user flows](user-flow-versions.md) where it's enabled. You enable age gating with the following steps:

1. Create a user flow that has age gating enabled.
1. After you create the user flow, select **Properties** in the menu.
1. In the **Age gating** section, select **Enabled**.
1. For **Sign-up or sign-in**, select how you want to manage users:
    - Allow minors to access your application.
    - Block only minors below age of consent from accessing your application.
    - Block all minors from accessing your application.
1. For **On block**, select one of the following options:
    - **Send a JSON back to the application** - this option sends a response back to the application that a minor was blocked.
    - **Show an error page** -  the user is shown a page informing them that they can't access the application.

## Test your user flow

1. To test your policy, select **Run user flow**.
1. For **Application**, select the web application named *testapp1* that you previously registered. The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.
1. Select the **Run user flow** button.
1. Sign-in with a local or social account. Then select your country/region of residence, and date of birth that simulate a minor. 
1. Repeat the test, and select a date of birth that simulates an adult.  

When you sign-in as a minor, you should see the following error message: *Unfortunately, your sign on has been blocked. Privacy and online safety laws in your country prevent access to accounts belonging to children.*

## Enable age gating in your custom policy

1. Get the example of an age gating policy on [GitHub](https://github.com/azure-ad-b2c/samples/tree/master/policies/age-gating).
1. In each file, replace the string `yourtenant` with the name of your Azure AD B2C tenant. For example, if the name of your B2C tenant is *contosob2c*, all instances of `yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com` become `contosob2c.onmicrosoft.com`.
1. Upload the policy files.
