# Create and run your own custom policies in Azure Active Directory B2C 

In Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), you can create user experiences by using [user flows or custom policies](user-flow-overview.md). You use custom policies when you want to create your own user journeys for complex identity experience scenarios that aren't supported by user flows.

User flows are already customizable such as [changing UI](customize-ui.md), [customizing language](language-customization.md) and using [custom attributes](user-flow-custom-attributes.md). However, these customizations might not cover all your business specific needs, which is the reason why you need custom policies.   

While you can use pre-made [custom policy starter pack](./tutorial-create-user-flows.md?pivots=b2c-custom-policy#custom-policy-starter-pack), it's important for you understand how custom policy is built from scratch. In this how-to guide series, you learn what you need to understand for you to customize the behavior of your user experience by using custom policies. At the end of this how-to guide series, you should be able to read and understand existing custom policies or write your own from scratch.
