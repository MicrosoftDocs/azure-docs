# Customer intent: I'm a developer integrating Azure AD B2C, and I want to configure an identity verification and proofing provider. I need to combat identity fraud and create a trusted user experience for account registration.

# Identity verification and proofing partners

With Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) and solutions from software-vendor partners, customers can enable end-user identity verification and proofing for account registration. Identity verification and proofing can check documents, knowledge-based information, and liveness.

## Architecture diagram

The following architecture diagram illustrates the verification and proofing flow.

   ![Diagram of the identity proofing flow, from registration to access approval.](./media/partner-gallery/third-party-identity-proofing.png)

1. User begins registration with a device.
2. User enters information.
3. Digital-risk score is assessed, then third-party identity proofing and identity validation occurs.
4. Identity is validated or rejected.
5. User attributes are passed to Azure Active Directory B2C.
6. If user verification is successful, a user account is created in Azure AD B2C during sign-in.
7. Based on the verification result, the user receives an access-approved or -denied message.
