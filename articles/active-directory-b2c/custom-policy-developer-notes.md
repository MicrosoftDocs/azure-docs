#Customer intent: As a developer using Azure Active Directory B2C, I want to understand the available features and their availability, so that I can make informed decisions about which features to use in my application development.

# Developer notes for Azure Active Directory B2C

Azure Active Directory B2C [user flows and custom policies](user-flow-overview.md) are generally available. Azure AD B2C capabilities are under continual development, so although most features are generally available, some features are at different stages in the software release cycle. This article discusses cumulative improvements in Azure AD B2C and specifies feature availability.

## Terms for features in public preview

- We encourage you to use public preview features for evaluation purposes only.

- [Service level agreements (SLAs)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/active-directory-b2c) don't apply to public preview features.

- Support requests for public preview features can be submitted through regular support channels.

## OAuth 2.0 application authorization flows

The following table summarizes the OAuth 2.0 and OpenId Connect application authentication flows that can be  integrated with Azure AD B2C.

|Feature  |User flow  |Custom policy  |Notes  |
|---------|:---------:|:---------:|---------|
[Authorization code](authorization-code-flow.md) | GA | GA | Allows users to sign in to web applications. The web application receives an authorization code. The authorization code is redeemed to acquire a token to call web APIs.|
[Authorization code with PKCE](authorization-code-flow.md)| GA | GA | Allows users to sign in to mobile and single-page applications. The application receives an authorization code using proof key for code exchange (PKCE). The authorization code is redeemed to acquire a token to call web APIs.  |
[Client credentials flow](client-credentials-grant-flow.md)| Preview | Preview | Allows access web-hosted resources by using the identity of an application. Commonly used for server-to-server interactions that must run in the background, without immediate interaction with a user. |
[Device authorization grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628)| NA | NA | Allows users to sign in to input-constrained devices such as a smart TV, IoT device, or printer.  |
[Implicit flow](implicit-flow-single-page-application.md) | GA | GA |  Allows users to sign in to single-page applications. The app gets tokens directly without performing a back-end server credential exchange. <br> **Note:** The recommended flow for supporting SPAs is [OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow (with PKCE)](./authorization-code-flow.md).|
[On-behalf-of](../active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow.md)| NA | NA | An application invokes a service or web API, which in turn needs to call another service or web API. <br />  <br /> For the middle-tier service to make authenticated requests to the downstream service, pass a *client credential* token in the authorization header. Optionally, you can include a custom header with the Azure AD B2C user's token.  |
[OpenId Connect](openid-connect.md) | GA | GA | OpenID Connect introduces the concept of an ID token, which is a security token that allows the client to verify the identity of the user. |
[OpenId Connect hybrid flow](openid-connect.md) | GA | GA | Allows a web application retrieve the ID token on the authorize request along with an authorization code.  |
[Resource owner password credentials (ROPC)](add-ropc-policy.md) | GA | GA | Allows a mobile application to sign in the user by directly handling their password. |
| [Sign-out](session-behavior.md#sign-out)| GA | GA | |
| [Single sign-out](session-behavior.md#sign-out)  | NA | Preview | |

## Responsibilities of custom policy feature-set developers

Manual policy configuration grants lower-level access to the underlying platform of Azure AD B2C and results in the creation of a unique, trust framework. The many possible permutations of custom identity providers, trust relationships, integrations with external services, and step-by-step workflows require a methodical approach to design and configuration.

Developers consuming the custom policy feature set should adhere to the following guidelines:

- Become familiar with the configuration language of the custom policies and key/secrets management. For more information, see [TrustFrameworkPolicy](trustframeworkpolicy.md).
- Take ownership of scenarios and custom integrations. Document your work and inform your live site organization.
- Perform methodical scenario testing.
- Follow software development and staging best practices. A minimum of one development and testing environment is recommended.
- Stay informed about new developments from the identity providers and services you integrate with. For example, keep track of changes in secrets and of scheduled and unscheduled changes to the service.
- Set up active monitoring, and monitor the responsiveness of production environments. For more information about integrating with Application Insights, see [Azure Active Directory B2C: Collecting Logs](analytics-with-application-insights.md).
- Keep contact email addresses current in the Azure subscription, and stay responsive to the Microsoft live-site team emails.
- Take timely action when advised to do so by the Microsoft live-site team.
