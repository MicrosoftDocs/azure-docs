# Configure authentication in a sample web app by using Azure AD B2C

This article uses a sample ASP.NET web application to illustrate how to add Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) authentication to your web applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sample ASP.NET web app that's referenced in this article can't be used to call a REST API, because it returns an ID token and not an access token. For a web app that can call a REST API, see [Secure a Web API that's built with ASP.NET Core by using Azure AD B2C](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/4-WebApp-your-API/4-2-B2C).  

## Overview

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol that's built on OAuth 2.0. You can use OIDC to securely sign users in to an application. This web app sample uses [Microsoft Identity Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Web). Microsoft Identity Web is a set of ASP.NET Core libraries that simplify adding authentication and authorization support to web apps. 

The sign in flow involves the following steps:

1. Users go to the web app and select **Sign-in**. 
1. The app initiates an authentication request and redirects users to Azure AD B2C.
1. Users [sign up or sign in](add-sign-up-and-sign-in-policy.md) and [reset the password](add-password-reset-policy.md). Alternatively, they can sign in with a [social account](add-identity-provider.md).
1. After users sign in successfully, Azure AD B2C returns an ID token to the app.
1. The app validates the ID token, reads the claims, and returns a secure page to users.

When the ID token is expired or the app session is invalidated, the app initiates a new authentication request and redirects users to Azure AD B2C. If the Azure AD B2C [SSO session](session-behavior.md) is active, Azure AD B2C issues an access token without prompting users to sign in again. If the Azure AD B2C session expires or becomes invalid, users are prompted to sign in again.

* [Visual Studio 2022 17.0 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads), with the ASP.NET and web development workload
* [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [C# for Visual Studio Code (latest version)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
* [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)

## Step 1: Configure your user flow

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow.md)]

## Step 2: Register a web application

To enable your application to sign in with Azure AD B2C, register your app in the Azure AD B2C directory. Registering your app establishes a trust relationship between the app and Azure AD B2C.  

During app registration, you'll specify the *redirect URI*. The redirect URI is the endpoint to which users are redirected by Azure AD B2C after they authenticate with Azure AD B2C. The app registration process generates an *application ID*, also known as the *client ID*, that uniquely identifies your app. After your app is registered, Azure AD B2C uses both the application ID and the redirect URI to create authentication requests. 

To create the web app registration, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Azure AD B2C tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Select **App registrations**, and then select **New registration**.
1. Under **Name**, enter a name for the application (for example, *webapp1*).
1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any identity provider or organizational directory (for authenticating users with user flows)**. 
1. Under **Redirect URI**, select **Web** and then, in the URL box, enter `https://localhost:44316/signin-oidc`.
1. Under **Manage**, select the **Authentication**, go to **Implicit grant and hybrid flows**, select the **ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows)** checkbox.
1. Under **Permissions**, select the **Grant admin consent to openid and offline access permissions** checkbox.
1. Select **Register**.
1. Select **Overview**.
1. Record the **Application (client) ID** for later use, when you configure the web application.

## Step 3: Get the web app sample

[Download the zip file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), or clone the sample web application from GitHub. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2
```

Extract the sample file to a folder where the total length of the path is 260 or fewer characters.

## Step 4: Configure the sample web app

In the sample folder, under the *1-WebApp-OIDC/1-5-B2C/* folder, open the **WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet.csproj** project with Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. 

Under the project root folder, open the *appsettings.json* file. This file contains information about your Azure AD B2C identity provider. Update the following app settings properties: 

|Section  |Key  |Value  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|AzureAdB2C|Instance| The first part of your Azure AD B2C [tenant name]( tenant-management-read-tenant-name.md#get-your-tenant-name) (for example, `https://contoso.b2clogin.com`).|
|AzureAdB2C|Domain| Your Azure AD B2C tenant full [tenant name]( tenant-management-read-tenant-name.md#get-your-tenant-name) (for example, `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`).|
|AzureAdB2C|ClientId| The Web App Application (client) ID from [step 2](#step-2-register-a-web-application).|
|AzureAdB2C|SignUpSignInPolicyId|The user flows or custom policy you created in [step 1](#step-1-configure-your-user-flow).|

Your final configuration file should look like the following JSON:

```JSON
"AzureAdB2C": {
  "Instance": "https://contoso.b2clogin.com",
  "Domain": "contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
  "ClientId": "<web-app-application-id>",
  "SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout/<your-sign-up-in-policy>",
  "SignUpSignInPolicyId": "<your-sign-up-in-policy>"
}
```

## Step 5: Run the sample web app

1. Build and run the project.
1. Go to `https://localhost:44316`. 
1. Select **Sign Up/In**.

1. Complete the sign-up or sign in process.

After successful authentication, you'll see your display name on the navigation bar. To view the claims that the Azure AD B2C token returns to your app, select **Claims**.

## Deploy your application 

In a production application, the app registration redirect URI is ordinarily a publicly accessible endpoint where your app is running, such as `https://contoso.com/signin-oidc`. 

You can add and modify redirect URIs in your registered applications at any time. The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs:

* The reply URL must begin with the scheme `https`.
* The reply URL is case-sensitive. Its case must match the case of the URL path of your running application.
