Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides an easy way for your business to manage identity and access, both in the cloud and on-premises. Your users can use one work or school account for single sign-on to any cloud and on-premises web application, using their favorite device, including iOS, Mac OS X, Android, and Windows devices. Your organization can protect sensitive data and applications both on-premises and in the cloud with integrated multi-factor authentication ensuring secure local and remote access. Or extend your on-premises directories so that information workers can use a single organizational account to securely and consistently access their corporate resources. Azure AD also offers comprehensive reports, analytics, and self-service capabilities to reduce costs and enhance security. And with Azure AD’s enterprise scale and SLA, your business will continue running at all times.
