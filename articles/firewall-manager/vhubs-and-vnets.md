# What are the Azure Firewall Manager architecture options?

Azure Firewall Manager can provide security management for two network architecture types:

- **secured virtual hub**

   An [Azure Virtual WAN Hub](../virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about.md#resources) is a Microsoft-managed resource that lets you easily create hub and spoke architectures. When security and routing policies associate with such a hub, it's known as a *[secured virtual hub](secured-virtual-hub.md)*. 
- **hub virtual network**

   This is a standard Azure virtual network that you create and manage yourself. When security policies are associated with such a hub, it's known as a *hub virtual network*. At this time, only Azure Firewall Policy is supported. You can peer spoke virtual networks that contain your workload servers and services. You can also manage firewalls in standalone virtual networks that aren't peered to any spoke.

## Comparison

The following table compares these two architecture options and can help you decide which one is right for your organization's security requirements:


|  |**Hub virtual network**|**Secured virtual hub**  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Underlying resource**     |Virtual network|Virtual WAN Hub|
|**Hub & Spoke**     |Uses Virtual network peering|Automated using hub virtual network connection|
|**On-prem connectivity**     |VPN Gateway up to 10 Gbps and 30 S2S connections; ExpressRoute|More scalable VPN Gateway up 20 Gbps and 1000 S2S connections; Express Route|
|**Automated branch connectivity using SDWAN**      |Not supported|Supported|
|**Hubs per region**     |Multiple Virtual Networks per region|Multiple Virtual Hubs per region|
|**Azure Firewall â€“ multiple public IP addresses**      |Customer provided|Auto generated|
|**Azure Firewall Availability Zones**     |Supported|Supported|
|**Advanced Internet security with third-party Security as a Service partners**     |Customer established and managed VPN connectivity to partner service of choice|Automated via security partner provider flow and partner management experience|
|**Centralized route management to route traffic to the hub**     |Customer-managed User Defined Route|Supported using BGP|
|**Multiple security provider support**|Supported with manually configured forced tunneling to third-party firewalls|Automated support for two security providers: Azure Firewall for private traffic filtering and third-party for Internet filtering|
|**Web Application Firewall on Application Gateway** |Supported in Virtual Network|Currently supported in spoke network|
|**Network Virtual Appliance**|Supported in Virtual Network|Currently supported in spoke network|
|**Azure DDoS Protection support**|Yes|No|
