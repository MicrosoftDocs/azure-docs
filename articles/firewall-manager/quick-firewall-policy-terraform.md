# Quickstart: Create an Azure Firewall and a firewall policy - Terraform

In this quickstart, you use Terraform to create an Azure Firewall and a firewall policy. The firewall policy has an application rule that allows connections to `www.microsoft.com` and a rule that allows connections to Windows Update using the **WindowsUpdate** FQDN tag. A network rule allows UDP connections to a time server at 13.86.101.172.

Also, IP Groups are used in the rules to define the **Source** IP addresses.

[Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure. It codifies infrastructure in configuration files that describe the desired state for your topology. Terraform enables the management of any infrastructure - such as public clouds, private clouds, and SaaS services - by using [Terraform providers](https://www.terraform.io/language/providers).

For information about IP Groups, see [IP Groups in Azure Firewall](../firewall/ip-groups.md).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md)]

- [Install and configure Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/quickstart-configure)

## Review and Implement the Terraform code

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code for this article is located in the [Azure Terraform GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-front-door-classic). You can view the log file containing the [test results from current and previous versions of Terraform](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-front-door-classic/TestRecord.md).

Multiple Azure resources are defined in the Terraform code. The following resources are defined in the `main.tf` file:

- [azurerm_resource_group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/resource_group)
- [azurerm_virtual_network](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/virtual_network)
- [azurerm_subnet](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/subnet)
- [azurerm_ip_group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/ip_group)
- [azurerm_public_ip](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/public_ip)
- [azurerm_firewall_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/firewall_policy)
- [azurerm_firewall_policy_rule_collection_group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/firewall_policy_rule_collection_group)
- [azurerm_firewall](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/firewall)

1. Create a directory in which to test the sample Terraform code and make it the current directory.

1. Create a file named `provider.tf` and insert the following code:

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-azfw-with-fwpolicy/provider.tf":::

1. Create a file named `main.tf` and insert the following code:

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-azfw-with-fwpolicy/main.tf":::

1. Create a file named `variables.tf` and insert the following code:

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-azfw-with-fwpolicy/variables.tf":::

1. Create a file named `outputs.tf` and insert the following code, being sure to update the value to your own backend hostname:

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-azfw-with-fwpolicy/outputs.tf":::

## Initialize Terraform

[!INCLUDE [terraform-init.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-init.md)]

## Create a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-plan.md)]

## Apply a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-apply-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-apply-plan.md)]

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [terraform-plan-destroy.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-plan-destroy.md)]
