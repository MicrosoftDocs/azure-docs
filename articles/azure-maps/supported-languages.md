# Localization support in Azure Maps

Azure Maps supports various languages and views based on country/region. This article provides the supported languages and views to help guide your Azure Maps implementation.

## Azure Maps supported languages

> [!NOTE]
> For supported cultures, street names are localized to the local language. For instance, if you request a location in France, the street names are in French. However, the level of localization for other data, such as country or region names, can vary by culture. For example, not every culture code can have a localized name for 'United States.'

Azure Maps is localized in variety languages across its services. The following table provides the supported language codes for each service.

## Azure Maps supported views

You need to configure the View parameter as required for the REST APIs and the Web SDK, for the services being used.

Azure Maps **View** parameter (also referred to as "user region parameter") is a two letter ISO-3166 country/region Code that shows the correct maps for that country/region specifying which set of geopolitically disputed content is returned via Azure Maps services, including borders and labels displayed on the map.

### REST APIs
  
Configuring the View parameter is required. This parameter determines which set of geopolitically disputed content is returned by Azure Maps services.

### SDKs

You need to have the latest version of Web SDK and configure the View parameter as required. This parameter determines which set of geopolitically disputed content the Azure Maps service returns.

By default, the View parameter is set to **Unified**, even if not defined in the request. Determine the location of your users. Then, set the **View** parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you can set 'View=Auto', which returns the map data based on the IP address of the request.  The **View** parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those laws about mapping of the country/region where maps, images, and other data and third-party content that you're authorized to access via Azure Maps is made available.

The following table provides supported views.
