## Azure Maps supported views

Make sure you set up the **View** parameter as required for the REST APIs and the SDKs, which your services are using.

Azure Maps **View** parameter (also referred to as "user region parameter") is a two letter ISO-3166 Country Code that shows the correct maps for that country/region specifying which set of geopolitically disputed content is returned via Azure Maps services, including borders and labels displayed on the map.

### REST APIs
  
Ensure that you have set up the View parameter as required. View parameter specifies which set of geopolitically disputed content is returned via Azure Maps services.

Affected Azure Maps REST services:

* Get Map Tile
* Get Map Image
* Get Search Fuzzy
* Get Search POI
* Get Search POI Category
* Get Search Nearby
* Get Search Address
* Get Search Address Structured
* Get Search Address Reverse
* Get Search Address Reverse Cross Street
* Post Search Inside Geometry
* Post Search Address Batch
* Post Search Address Reverse Batch
* Post Search Along Route
* Post Search Fuzzy Batch

### SDKs

Make sure the `View` parameter is configured as needed, and that you are using the latest version of the Web SDK.

The `View` parameter is set to _Unified_ By default, even if it is not explicitly defined in the request. First, determine the location of your users, then set the View parameter to that location. Alternatively, you can use 'View=Auto' to return map data based on the request's IP address. Ensure that the `View` parameter in Azure Maps is used in compliance with applicable laws, including those related to mapping in the country or region where the maps, images, and other data, as well as third-party content accessed via Azure Maps, are made available.

The following table provides supported views.
