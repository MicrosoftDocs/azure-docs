<a name="tile-layer"></a> **Tile layer**: A layer displayed by assembling map tiles (rectangular sections) into a continuous layer. The tiles are either raster image tiles or vector tiles. Raster tile layers are typically rendered ahead of time, and they're stored as images on a server. Raster tile layers may use a large storage space. Vector tile layers are rendered near real time within the client application. Thus, the server-side storage requirements are smaller for vector tile layers.

<a name="time-zone"></a> **Time zone**: A region of the globe that observes a uniform standard time for legal, commercial, and social purposes. Time zones tend to follow the boundaries of countries/regions and their subdivisions.

<a name="transaction"></a> **Transaction**: Azure Maps uses a transactional licensing model where;

- One transaction is created for every 15 map or traffic tiles requested.
- One transaction is created for each API call to one of the services in Azure Maps. Searching and routing are examples of Azure Maps service.

<a name="transformation"></a> **Transformation**: The process of converting data between different geographic coordinate systems. You may, for example, have some data that was captured in the United Kingdom and based on the OSGB 1936 geographic coordinate system. Azure Maps uses the [EPSG:3857] coordinate reference system variant of WGS84. As such to display the data correctly, it needs to have its coordinates transformed from one system to another.

<a name="traveling-salesmen-problem-tsp"></a> **Traveling Salesmen Problem (TSP)**:  A Hamiltonian circuit problem in which a salesperson must find the most efficient way to visit a series of stops, then return to the starting location.

These constraints may include delivery time windows, multiple route capacities, and travel duration constraints.

<a name="voronoi-diagram"></a> **Voronoi diagram**: A partition of space into areas, or cells, that surrounds a set of geometric objects, usually point features. These cells, or polygons, must satisfy the criteria for Delaunay triangles. All locations within an area are closer to the object it surrounds than to any other object in the set. Voronoi diagrams are often used to delineate areas of influence around geographic features.

<a name="web-map-service-wms"></a> **Web Map Service (WMS)**: WMS is an Open Geographic Consortium (OGC) standard that defines image-based map services. WMS services provide map images for specific areas within a map on demand. Images include prerendered symbology and may be rendered in one of several named styles if defined by the service.

<a name="web-mercator"></a> **Web Mercator**: Also known as Spherical Mercator projection. It's a slight variant of the Mercator projection, one used primarily in Web-based mapping programs. It uses the same formulas as the standard Mercator projection as used for small-scale maps. However, the Web Mercator uses the spherical formulas at all scales, but large-scale Mercator maps normally use the ellipsoidal form of the projection. The discrepancy is imperceptible at the global scale, but it causes maps of local areas to deviate slightly from true ellipsoidal Mercator maps, at the same scale.

<a name="wgs84"></a> **WGS84**: A set of constants used to relate spatial coordinates to locations on the surface of the map. The WGS84 datum is the standard one used by most online mapping providers and GPS devices. Azure Maps uses the [EPSG:3857] coordinate reference system variant of WGS84.

<a name="Zoom level"></a> **Zoom level**: Specifies the level of detail and how much of the map is visible. When zoomed all the way to level 0, the full world map is often visible. But, the map shows limited details such as country/region names, borders, and ocean names. When zoomed in closer to level 17, the map displays an area of a few city blocks with detailed road information. In Azure Maps, the highest zoom level is 22. For more information, see the [Zoom levels and tile grid] documentation.
