# Manage your Azure Maps account

You can manage your Azure Maps account through the Azure portal. After you have an account, you can implement the APIs in your website or mobile application.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account] before you continue.
- For picking account location, if you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, see [managed identities for Azure resources].

## Account location

Picking a location for your Azure Maps account that aligns with other resources in your subscription, like managed identities, may help to improve the level of service for [control-plane] operations.

As an example, the managed identity infrastructure notifies the Azure Maps management services for changes to the identity resource such as credential renewal or deletion. Sharing the same Azure location enables a consistent infrastructure provisioning for all resources.

An Azure Maps account, regardless of location, can access any endpoint belonging to the Azure data-plane, such as `atlas.microsoft.com` and `*.atlas.microsoft.com`, when using Azure Maps REST API.

## Create a new account

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal].

2. Select **Create a resource** in the upper-left corner of the Azure portal.

3. Search for and select **Maps**. Then select **Create**.

4. Enter the information for your new account.
