# Manage your Azure Maps account

You can manage your Azure Maps account through the Azure portal. After you have an account, you can implement the APIs in your website or mobile application.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create a new account

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Select **Create a resource** in the upper-left corner of the Azure portal.

3. Search for and select **Maps**. Then select **Create**.

4. Enter the information for your new account.

## Delete an account

You can delete an account from the Azure portal. Navigate to the account overview page and select **Delete**.
