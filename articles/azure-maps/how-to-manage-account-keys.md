# How to manage your Azure Maps account and keys

You can manage your Azure Maps account and keys through the Azure portal. Once you have an account and a key, you can implement the APIs in your web site or mobile application.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Log in to Azure 

Log in to the Azure portal at http://portal.azure.com.

## Create a new account

1. Click **Create a resource** in the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.

2. Search for and select **Maps**, then click **Create**.

3. Enter the Maps Account information.
