# Add a pie chart layer

This article describes how to add a pie chart layer to an Azure Maps Power BI visual.

A pie chart is a visual representation of data in the form of a circular chart or *pie* where each slice represents an element of the dataset that is shown as a percentage of the whole. A list of numerical variables along with categorical (location) variables are required to represent data in the form of a pie chart.

## Prerequisites

- [Get started with Azure Maps Power BI visual].
- Understand [Layers in the Azure Maps Power BI visual].

## Add the pie chart layer

The pie chart layer is added automatically based on what fields in the **Visualizations** pane have values, these fields include location, size and legend.

The following steps walk you through creating a pie chart layer.

1. Select two location sources from the **Fields** pane, such as city/state, to add to the **Location** field.
1. Select a numerical field from your table, such as sales, and add it to the **Size** field in the **Visualizations** pane. This field must contain the numerical values used in the pie chart.
1. Select a data field from your table that can be used as the category that the numerical field applies to, such as *manufacturer*, and add it to the **Legend** field in the **Visualizations** pane. This appears as the slices of the pie, the size of each slice is a percentage of the whole based on the value in the size field, such as the number of sales broken out by manufacturer.
1. Next, in the **Format** tab of the **Visualizations** pane, switch the **Bubbles** toggle to **On**.

The pie chart layer should now appear. Next you can adjust the Pie chart settings such as size and transparency.

## Pie chart layer settings

Pie Chart layer is an extension of the bubbles layer, so all settings are made in the **Bubbles** section. If a field is passed into the **Legend** bucket of the **Fields** pane, the pie charts are populated and colored based on their categorization. The outline of the pie chart is white by default but can be changed to a new color. The following are the settings in the **Format** tab of the **Visualizations** pane that are available to a **Pie Chart layer**.

| Setting               | Description                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Size                  | The size of each bubble.                                          |
| Fill transparency     | Transparency of each pie chart.                                   |
| Outline color         | Color that outlines the pie chart.                                |
| Outline transparency  | Transparency of the outline.                                      |
| Outline width         | Width of the outline in pixels.                                   |
| Min zoom              | Minimum zoom level tiles are available.                           |
| Max zoom              | Maximum zoom level tiles are available.                           |
| Layer position        | Specifies the position of the layer relative to other map layers. |

## Next steps
