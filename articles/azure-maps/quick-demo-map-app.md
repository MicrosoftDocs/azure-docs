# Quickstart: Create an interactive search map with Azure Maps

This quickstart demonstrates how to use Azure Maps to create a map that gives users an interactive search experience. It walks you through these basic steps:

* Create your own Azure Maps account.
* Get your Azure Maps subscription key to use in the demo web application.
* Download and open the demo map application.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account] before you begin.

* Sign in to the [Azure portal].

## Create an Azure Maps account

Create a new Azure Maps account with the following steps:

1. Select **Create a resource** in the upper left-hand corner of the [Azure portal].
2. Type **Azure Maps** in the *Search services and Marketplace* box.
3. Select **Azure Maps** in the drop-down list that appears, then select the **Create** button.
4. On the **Create an Azure Maps Account resource** page, enter the following values then select the **Create** button:
    * The *Subscription* that you want to use for this account.
    * The *Resource group* name for this account. You may choose to *Create new* or *Select existing* resource group.
    * The *Name* of your new Azure Maps account.
    * The *Pricing tier* for this account. Select **Gen2**.
    * Read the *License* and *Privacy Statement*, then select the checkbox to accept the terms.

## Get the subscription key for your account

Once your Azure Maps account is successfully created, retrieve the subscription key that enables you to query the Maps APIs.

1. Open your Maps account in the portal.
2. In the settings section, select **Authentication**.
3. Copy the **Primary Key** and save it locally to use later in this tutorial.

>[!NOTE]
> This quickstart uses the [Shared Key] authentication approach for demonstration purposes, but the preferred approach for any production environment is to use [Microsoft Entra ID] authentication.

## Download and update the Azure Maps demo

1. Copy the contents of the file: [Interactive Search Quickstart.html].
2. Save the contents of this file locally as **AzureMapDemo.html**. Open it in a text editor.
3. Add the **Primary Key** value you got in the preceding section
    1. Comment out all of the code in the `authOptions` function, this code is used for Microsoft Entra authentication.
    1. Uncomment the last two lines in the `authOptions` function, this code is used for Shared Key authentication, the approach being used in this quickstart.
    1. Replace `<Your Azure Maps Key>` with the subscription key value from the preceding section.

## Open the demo application

1. Open the file **AzureMapDemo.html** in a browser of your choice.
2. Observe the map shown of the City of Los Angeles. Zoom in and out to see how the map automatically renders with more or less information depending on the zoom level.
3. Change the default center of the map. In the **AzureMapDemo.html** file, search for the variable named **center**. Replace the longitude, latitude pair value for this variable with the new values **[-74.0060, 40.7128]**. Save the file and refresh your browser.
4. Try out the interactive search experience. In the search box on the upper-left corner of the demo web application, search for **restaurants**.
5. Move your mouse over the list of addresses and locations that appear below the search box. Notice how the corresponding pin on the map pops out information about that location. For privacy of private businesses, fictitious names and addresses are shown.

## Clean up resources

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The tutorials listed in the [Next Steps] section detail how to use and configure Azure Maps with your account. Don't clean up the resources created in this quickstart if you plan to continue to the tutorials.

If you don't plan to continue to the tutorials, take these steps to clean up the resources:

1. Close the browser that runs the **AzureMapDemo.html** web application.
2. Navigate to the Azure portal. Select **All resources** from the main portal page, or select the menu icon in the upper left-hand corner then **All resources**.
3. Select your Azure Maps account, then select **Delete** at the top of the page.
