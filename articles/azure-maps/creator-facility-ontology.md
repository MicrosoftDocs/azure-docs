# Facility Ontology

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Azure Maps Creator retirement**
>
> The Azure Maps Creator indoor map service is now deprecated and will be retired on 9/30/25. For more information, see [End of Life Announcement of Azure Maps Creator](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsCreatorDeprecation).

Facility ontology defines how Azure Maps Creator internally stores facility data in a Creator dataset.  In addition to defining internal facility data structure, facility ontology is also exposed externally through the WFS API. When WFS API is used to query facility data in a dataset, the response format is defined by the ontology supplied to that dataset.

## Changes and Revisions

:::zone pivot="facility-ontology-v1"

The Facility 1.0 contains revisions for the Facility feature class definitions for [Azure Maps services].

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="facility-ontology-v2"

The Facility 2.0 contains revisions for the Facility feature class definitions for [Azure Maps services].

:::zone-end

### Major Changes

:::zone pivot="facility-ontology-v1"

Fixed the following constraint validation checks:

* Constraint validation check for exclusivity of `isObstruction = true` *or* the presence of `obstructionArea` for `lineElement` and `areaElement` feature classes.

* Constraint validation check for exclusivity of `isRoutable = true` *or* the presence of `routeThroughBehavior` for the `category` feature class.
:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="facility-ontology-v2"

* Added a structure feature class to hold walls, columns, and so on.
* Cleaned up the attributes designed to enrich routing scenarios. The current routing engine doesn't support them.

## Feature collection

:::zone pivot="facility-ontology-v1"

At a high level, the facility ontology consists of feature collections, each contains an array of feature objects. All feature objects have two fields in common, `ID` and `Geometry`. When importing a drawing package into Azure Maps Creator, these fields are automatically generated.

:::zone pivot="facility-ontology-v2"

At a high level, the facility ontology consists of feature collections, each contains an array of feature objects. All feature objects have two fields in common, `ID` and `Geometry`.

# [Drawing package](#tab/dwg)

When importing a drawing package into Azure Maps Creator, these fields are automatically generated.

# [GeoJSON package (preview)](#tab/geojson)

Support for creating a [dataset] from a GeoJSON package is now available as a new feature in preview in Azure Maps Creator.

When importing a GeoJSON package, the `ID` and `Geometry` fields must be supplied with each [feature object] in each GeoJSON file in the package.

| Property    | Type   | Required | Description |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------------|
|`Geometry` | object | true | Each Geometry object consists of a `type` and `coordinates` array. While a required field, the value can be set to `null`. For more information, see [Geometry Object] in the GeoJSON (RFC 7946) format specification. |
|`ID` | string | true | The value of this field can be alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z), dots (.), hyphens (-) and underscores (_). Maximum length allowed is 1,000 characters.|

For more information, see [Create a dataset using a GeoJson package].

:::zone-end

In addition to these common fields, each feature class defines a set of properties. Each property is defined by its data type and constraints. Some feature classes have properties that are dependent on other feature classes. Dependant properties evaluate to the `ID` of another feature class.

The remaining sections in this article define the different feature classes and their properties that make up the facility ontology in Microsoft Azure Maps Creator.

## unit

The `unit` feature class defines a physical and non-overlapping area that can be occupied and traversed by a navigating agent. A `unit` can be a hallway, a room, a courtyard, and so on.
