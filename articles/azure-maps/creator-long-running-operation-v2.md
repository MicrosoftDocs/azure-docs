Some APIs in Azure Maps use an [Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern]. This pattern allows Azure Maps to provide highly available and responsive services. This article explains Azure Map's specific implementation of long-running asynchronous background processing.

## Submit a request

A client application starts a long-running operation through a synchronous call to an HTTP API. Typically, this call is in the form of an HTTP POST request. When an asynchronous workload is successfully created, the API returns an HTTP `202` status code, indicating that the request has been accepted. This response contains a `Location` header pointing to an endpoint that the client can poll to check the status of the long-running operation.

### Example of a success response

```HTTP
Status: 202 Accepted
Operation-Location: https://atlas.microsoft.com/service/operations/{operationId} 

```

If the call doesn't pass validation, the API returns an HTTP `400` response for a Bad Request. The response body provides the client more information on why the request was invalid.

### Monitor the operation status

The location endpoint provided in the accepted response headers can be polled to check the status of the long-running operation. The response body from operation status request always contains the `status` and the `created` properties. The `status` property shows the current state of the long-running operation. Possible states include `"NotStarted"`, `"Running"`, `"Succeeded"`, and `"Failed"`. The `created` property shows the time the initial request was made to start the long-running operation. When the state is either `"NotStarted"` or `"Running"`, a `Retry-After` header is also provided with the response. The `Retry-After` header, measured in seconds, can be used to determine when the next polling call to the operation status API should be made.

### Example of running a status response

```HTTP
Status: 200 OK
Retry-After: 30
{
    "operationId": "c587574e-add9-4ef7-9788-1635bed9a87e",
    "created": "3/11/2020 8:45:13 PM +00:00",
    "status": "Running"
}
```

## Handle operation completion

Once the long-running operation completes, the status of the response is either `"Succeeded"` or `"Failed"`. All responses return an HTTP 200 OK code. When a new resource has been created from a long-running operation, the response also contains a `Resource-Location` header that points to metadata about the resource. Upon a failure, the response has an `error` property in the body. The error data adheres to the OData error specification.

### Example of success response

```HTTP
Status: 200 OK
Resource-Location: "https://atlas.microsoft.com/tileset/{tileset-id}"
 {
    "operationId": "c587574e-add9-4ef7-9788-1635bed9a87e",
    "created": "2021-05-06T07:55:19.5256829+00:00",
    "status": "Succeeded"
}
```

### Example of failure response

```HTTP
Status: 200 OK

{
    "operationId": "c587574e-add9-4ef7-9788-1635bed9a87e",
    "created": "3/11/2020 8:45:13 PM +00:00",
    "status": "Failed",
    "error": {
        "code": "InvalidFeature",
        "message": "The provided feature is invalid.",
        "details": {
            "code": "NoGeometry",
            "message": "No geometry was provided with the feature."
        }
    }
}
```
