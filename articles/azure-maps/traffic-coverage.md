# Azure Maps - Traffic Coverage

Azure Maps provides rich traffic information in the form of flow and incidents that can be served as overlays atop of the Azure Maps map control or used in conjunction with the Azure Maps Route Service. The following table provides coverage information for Azure Maps traffic, so users have insight on where to expect (and not expect) traffic information.
