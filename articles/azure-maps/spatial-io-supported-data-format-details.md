# Supported data format details

This article provides specifics on the read and write support for all XML tags and Well-Known Text geometry types. It also details how the delimited spatial data is parsed in the spatial IO module.

## Supported XML namespaces

The spatial IO module supports XML tags from the following namespaces.

| Namespace Prefix | Namespace URI   | Notes                                                                    |
|:-----------------|:----------------|:----------------------------------------|
| `atom`           | `http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom`   |                                         |
| `geo`            | `http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#`  | Read only support in GeoRSS files.           |
| `georss`         | `http://www.georss.org/georss`  |                                                |
| `geourl`         | `http://geourl.org/rss/module/` | Read only support in GeoRSS files.                       |
| `gml`            | `http://www.opengis.net/gml`    |                                                        |
| `gpx`            | `http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1` |                                                   |
| `gpxx`           | `http://www.garmin.com/xmlschemas/GpxExtensions/v3` | Read only support in GPX files. Parses and uses DisplayColor. All other properties added to shape metadata. |
| `gpx_style`      | `http://www.topografix.com/GPX/gpx_style/0/2`      | Supported in GPX files. Uses line color. |
| `gx`             | `http://www.google.com/kml/ext/2.2` |                                                      |
| `kml`            | `http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2`    |                                                      |
| `rss`            |                                 | Read only. GeoRSS writes using Atom format.              |

## Supported XML elements

The spatial IO module supports the following XML elements. Any XML tags that aren't supported are converted into a JSON object. Then, each tag is added as a property in the `properties` field of the parent shape or layer.

### KML elements

The spatial IO module supports the following KML elements.

| Element Name         | Read    | Write   | Notes                                                                   |

#### More notes

- Member elements are searched for a geometry that may be buried within child elements. This search operation is necessary as many XML formats that extend from GML may not place a geometry as a direct child of a member element.
- `srsName` is partially supported for WGS84 coordinates and the following codes:[EPSG:4326]), and web Mercator ([EPSG:3857] or one of its alternative codes. Any other coordinate system is parsed as WGS84 as-is.
- Unless specified when reading an XML feed, the axis order is determined based on hints in the XML feed. A preference is given for the "latitude, longitude" axis order.
- Unless a custom GML namespace is specified for the properties when writing to a GML file, other property information isn't added.

## Delimited spatial data support

Delimited spatial data, such as comma-separated value files (CSV), often have columns that contain spatial data. For example, there could be columns that contain latitude and longitude information. In Well-Known Text format, there could be a column that contains spatial geometry data.

### Spatial data column detection

When reading a delimited file that contains spatial data, the header is analyzed to determine which columns contain location fields. If the header contains type information, it's used to cast the cell values to the appropriate type. If no header is specified, the first row is analyzed to generate a header. When analyzing the first row, a check is executed to match column names with the following names in a case-insensitive way. The order of the names is the priority, in case two or more names exist in a file.

#### Latitude

- `latitude`
- `lat`
- `latdd`
- `lat_dd`
- `latitude83`
- `latdecdeg`
- `y`
- `ycenter`
- `point-y`

#### Longitude

- `longitude`
- `lon`
- `lng`
- `long`
- `longdd`
- `long_dd`
- `longitude83`
- `longdecdeg`
- `x`
- `xcenter`
- `point-x`

#### Elevation

- `elevation`
- `elv`
- `altitude`
- `alt`
- `z`

#### Geography

The first row of data is scanned for strings that are in Well-Known Text format.

### Delimited data column types

When scanning the header row, any type information that is in the column name is extracted and used to cast the cells in that column. Here's an example of a column name that has a type value: "ColumnName (typeName)". The following case-insensitive type names are supported:

#### Numbers

- edm.int64
- int
- long
- edm.double
- float
- double
- number

#### Booleans

- edm.boolean
- bool
- boolean

#### Dates

- edm.datetime
- date
- datetime

#### Geography

- edm.geography
- geography

#### Strings

- edm.string
- varchar
- text
- string

If no type information can be extracted from the header, and the dynamic typing option is enabled when reading, then each cell is individually analyzed to determine what data type it's best suited to be cast as.
