# Azure Maps Power BI visual Data Residency

The Azure Maps Power BI visual can get a users' tenant location and use it to call the correct Azure Maps geographic endpoints. For instance, if a user's tenant is located in Europe, Power BI calls the Azure Maps' `eu` endpoint `eu.atlas.microsoft.com`, ensuring that their data doesn't leave the Europe region. Similarly if users' tenant is in the US, `us.atlas.microsoft.com` is called and users' data doesn't leave the US region.

## Tenant location

To discover your tenant's location in Power BI:

1. Open the Help menu drop-down list by selecting the `?`

1. Select **About Power BI**
1. Once the **About Power BI** dialog box opens, notice the **your data is stored in** followed by the Tenant location, which is, in this example, Ireland.

The previous example would use the `eu.atlas.microsoft.com` endpoint.
