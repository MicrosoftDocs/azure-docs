# Handle map events

This article shows you how to use [map events class]. The property highlight events on the map and on different layers of the map. You can also highlight events when you interact with an HTML marker.

## Interact with the map

The [Map Events] sample highlights the name of the events that are firing as you interact with the map. For the source code for this sample, see [Map Events source code].

## Interact with map layers

The [Layer Events] sample highlights the name of the events that are firing as you interact with the Symbol Layer. The symbol, bubble, line, and polygon layer all support the same set of events. The heat map and tile layers don't support any of these events. For the source code for this sample, see [Layer Events source code].

## Interact with HTML Marker

The [HTML marker layer events] sample highlights the name of the events that are firing as you interact with the HTML marker layer. For the source code for this sample, see [HTML marker layer Events source code].
