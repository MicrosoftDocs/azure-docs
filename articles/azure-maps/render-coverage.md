# Azure Maps Render service coverage

The render coverage tables below list the countries/regions that support Azure Maps road tiles. Both raster and vector tiles are supported. At the lowest resolution, the entire world fits in a single tile. At the highest resolution, a single tile represents 38 square meters. You'll see more details about continents, regions, cities, and individual streets as you zoom in the map. For more information about tiles, see [Zoom levels and tile grid].

> [!NOTE]

>
> The Azure Maps Render v1 service is now deprecated and will be retired on 9/17/26. To avoid service disruptions, all calls to Render v1 API will need to be updated to use the [latest version] by 9/17/26.
