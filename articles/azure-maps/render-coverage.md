# Azure Maps render coverage

The render coverage tables below list the countries that support Azure Maps road tiles. Both raster and vector tiles are supported. At the lowest resolution, the entire world fits in a single tile. At the highest resolution, a single tile represents 38 square meters. You'll see more details about continents, regions, cities, and individual streets as you zoom in the map. For more information about tiles, see [Zoom levels and tile grid](zoom-levels-and-tile-grid.md).
