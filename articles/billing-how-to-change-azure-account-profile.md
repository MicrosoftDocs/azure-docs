## Important information about your profile email address

The email address in the Account Administrator’s profile is used by Microsoft to notify you about important billing-related updates about the subscription. We recommend that you specify a contact email address that you check regularly.

## How to change your profile information

1.	Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/) as the account administrator and then click **Profile**. Or go to https://account.windowsazure.com/Profile.

2.	Select the **Edit details** button, and then update the **Profile** information.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I change the Account Administrator email address in my profile?

Yes. The Account Administrator is the person who set up the Azure account and who receives important email notifications about all the subscriptions under the account. We recommend that you specify a contact email address that the Account Administrator checks regularly.

### Does updating my profile email also update my login email address?

No. Updating the profile email address does not update your login email address. To change your login email address, you have to transfer ownership of the account.

### Does updating my profile address also update my credit card billing address?

No. You can update the billing address associated with your credit card by going to the [subscription page](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) in the Azure Account Center.

### Why can’t I update the country?

Because of technical constraints, we cannot change the country on an existing account. However, you can create a new account in the desired country and then contact Azure support to migrate your services to that account.

### What email address does the Azure Billing Alerts preview feature use?

If you sign up for the new Azure Billing Alerts preview feature, you will receive Azure Billing Alerts email at the address you specify, regardless of whether you have changed the Account Administrator email address.
