> You will need an Azure subscription where you have access to both [Contributor](../../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) role, and [User Access Administrator](../../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) role to the resource group under which you will creating new resources (user-assigned managed identity, storage account, Video Analyzer account). If you do not have the right permissions, please reach out to your account administrator to grant you those permissions. The associated storage account must be in the same region as the Video Analyzer account. It is recommended to use a [standard general-purpose v2](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#types-of-storage-accounts) storage account.
