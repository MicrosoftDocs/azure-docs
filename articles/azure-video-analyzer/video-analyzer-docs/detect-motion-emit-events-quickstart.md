# Quickstart: Detect motion and emit events


This quickstart walks you through the steps to get started with Azure Video Analyzer on IoT Edge. It uses an Azure VM as an IoT Edge device and a simulated live video stream. After completing the setup steps, you'll be able to run a simulated live video stream through a video pipeline that detects and reports any motion in that stream. The following diagram shows a graphical representation of that pipeline.

## Clean up resources

If you intend to try the other quickstarts, then you should keep the resources you created. Otherwise, in the Azure portal, go to your resource groups, select the resource group where you ran this quickstart, and then delete all of the resources.

## Next steps

Run the other quickstarts, such as detecting an object in a live video feed.
