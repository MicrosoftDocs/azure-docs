### Multiple changes to identity recommendations

**Estimated date for change:** October 2022

Defender for Cloud includes multiple recommendations for improving the management of users and accounts. In October, we'll be making the changes outlined below.

#### New recommendations in preview

The new release will bring the following capabilities:

- **Extended evaluation scope** – Improved coverage to identity accounts without MFA and external accounts on Azure resources (instead of subscriptions only) allowing security admins to view role assignments per account.

- **Improved freshness interval** - Currently, the identity recommendations have a freshness interval of 24 hours. This update will reduce that interval to 12 hours.

- **Account exemption capability** - Defender for Cloud has many features you can use to customize your experience and ensure that your secure score reflects your organization's security priorities. For example, you can [exempt resources and recommendations from your secure score](exempt-resource.md).

    This update will allow you to exempt specific accounts from evaluation with the six recommendations listed in the following table.

    Typically, you'd exempt emergency “break glass” accounts from MFA recommendations, because such accounts are often deliberately excluded from an organization's MFA requirements. Alternatively, you might have external accounts that you'd like to permit access to but which don't have MFA enabled.

    > [!TIP]
    > When you exempt an account, it won't be shown as unhealthy and also won't cause a subscription to appear  unhealthy.
