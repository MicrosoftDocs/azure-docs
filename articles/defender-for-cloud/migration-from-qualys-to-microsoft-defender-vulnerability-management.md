# Migration from Qualys to Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

Microsoft Defender for Cloud made a strategic decision to unify all vulnerability assessment solutions to use our in-house vulnerability scanner, Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, providing consistent and best of breed integration across all cloud native use cases, including workload types, multicloud, on-premises, agentless/agent offering, and throughout the software development lifecycle. For more information about the strategic decision to invest in Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, see [Defender for Cloud unifies Vulnerability Assessment solution powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-unified-vulnerability-assessment-powered-by/ba-p/3990112).

As part of this change, we also decided to retire our built-in vulnerability assessments offering powered by Qualys, allowing us to focus all our efforts on the new unified vulnerability assessments offering, and ensure we can provide the best customer value and rapidly expand to additional use cases.

The Defender for Cloud Containers Vulnerability Assessment powered by Qualys is now deprecated and will be fully retired on **March 1st, 2024**.

Customers that onboarded at least one subscription to Defender for Containers prior to **November 15th, 2023** will be able to continue to use Container Vulnerability Assessment powered by Qualys until **March 1st, 2024**.

We encourage our customers that are currently using the built vulnerability assessment solution powered by Qualys to start planning for the upcoming deprecations by following these steps.

## Step 1: Enable MDVM scanning for container images

Container vulnerability assessment scanning powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management is enabled by default for Defender for Containers, Defender for Container Registries (deprecated) and Defender Cloud Security Posture Management. Organizations that disabled it need to re-enable the **Agentless container vulnerability assessment** toggle in one of the plans. It reflects automatically to any of the mentioned plans enabled.

For more information on enabling MDVM scanning, see [Enable vulnerability assessment in Azure powered by MDVM](enable-vulnerability-assessment.md)

## Step 2: Transition to only view MDVM recommendations

If your organization is ready to migrate to container vulnerability assessment scanning powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management and no longer receive results from the Qualys recommendations, you can go ahead and disable the recommendations reporting on Qualys scanning results. Following are recommendation names and assessment keys to be referenced throughout this guide.

### Qualys recommendations and Assessment Key

| Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key
|--|--|--|
| [Azure registry container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Qualys)](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security_CloudNativeCompute/ContainerRegistryRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/dbd0cb49-b563-45e7-9724-889e799fa648)| Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for security vulnerabilities and exposes detailed findings for each image. Resolving the vulnerabilities can greatly improve your containers' security posture and protect them from attacks. | dbd0cb49-b563-45e7-9724-889e799fa648 |
| [Azure running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Qualys)](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security_CloudNativeCompute/KubernetesRuntimeVisibilityRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/41503391-efa5-47ee-9282-4eff6131462c) | Container image vulnerability assessment scans container images running on your Kubernetes clusters for security vulnerabilities and exposes detailed findings for each image. Resolving the vulnerabilities can greatly improve your containers' security posture and protect them from attacks. | 41503391-efa5-47ee-9282-4eff6131462c |

### MDVM recommendations and Assessment Key

| Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key

### Disable using the Qualys recommendations

To disable the above Qualys recommendations using the Defender for Cloud UI:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to Defender for Cloud and open the **Recommendations** page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/migration-from-qualys-to-microsoft-defender-vulnerability-management/select-recommendations.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Recommendations selection.":::

1. Search for one of the Qualys recommendations.

    :::image type="content" source="media/migration-from-qualys-to-microsoft-defender-vulnerability-management/powered-by-qualys.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Search for one of the Qualys recommendations.":::

1. Choose the recommendation and select **"Exempt"**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/migration-from-qualys-to-microsoft-defender-vulnerability-management/powered-by-qualys-select-exempt.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select Exempt.":::

1. Select the management group or subscriptions where you want to exempt the Qualys recommendation.

    :::image type="content" source="media/migration-from-qualys-to-microsoft-defender-vulnerability-management/powered-by-qualys-exempt.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of the management group or subscriptions to exempt.":::

1. Fill out the remaining details and select create. Wait up to 30 minutes for the exemptions to take effect.

## Step 3: (optional) Update REST API and Azure Resource Graph Queries

If you're currently accessing container vulnerability assessment results powered by Qualys programmatically, either via the Azure Resource Graph (ARG) Rest API or Subassessment REST API or ARG queries, you need to update your existing queries to match the new schema and/or REST API provided by the new container vulnerability assessment powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

The next section includes a few examples that can help in understanding how existing queries for the Qualys powered offering should be translated to equivalent queries with the Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management powered offering.

### ARG Query Examples

Any Azure Resource Graph queries used for reporting should be updated to reflect the MDVM assessmentKeys listed previously.  Following are examples to help you transition to MDVM queries.

### Step 4 (optional) Container Security Reporting

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides out of the box reporting via Azure Workbooks, including a Container Security workbook.

:::image type="content" source="media/migration-from-qualys-to-microsoft-defender-vulnerability-management/container-security-workbook.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Container Security workbook.":::

This workbook includes container vulnerability scanning results from both registry and runtime.

:::image type="content" source="media/migration-from-qualys-to-microsoft-defender-vulnerability-management/workbook-va-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of workbook including container vulnerability scanning results,":::

The workbook provides results from both Qualys and MDVM scanning, offering a comprehensive overview of vulnerabilities detected within your Azure Registry container images.  The Containers Security workbook provides the following benefits for container vulnerability assessment:

- **Dual Scanner Integration**: Users can easily compare results from both scanners in a single report while the Qualys results are still available. Filters also allow it to focus on results for a specific container registry or cluster.

- **Overview of all vulnerabilities**: View all vulnerabilities detected across your Azure Container Registries and running on the AKS cluster.

- **Exploitable vulnerabilities dashboard**: A dedicated section highlighting vulnerabilities with known exploits, enabling security teams to focus on vulnerabilities that pose a high risk of exploitation. This is only available with container vulnerability assessment scanning powered by MDVM.

    :::image type="content" source="media/migration-from-qualys-to-microsoft-defender-vulnerability-management/exploitable-vulnerabilities-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of exploitable vulnerabilities dashboard.":::

- **Additional ARG queries**: You can use this workbook to view additional examples of how to query ARG data between Qualys and MDVM. For more information on how to edit workbooks, see [Workbooks gallery in Microsoft Defender for Cloud]( custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks.md#workbooks-gallery-in-microsoft-defender-for-cloud).
