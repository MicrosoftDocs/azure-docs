  Configure the Microsoft Security DevOps Azure DevOps extension
introduction: |
  Microsoft Security DevOps is a command line application that integrates static analysis tools into the development lifecycle. Microsoft Security DevOps installs, configures, and runs the latest versions of static analysis tools (including, but not limited to, SDL/security and compliance tools). Microsoft Security DevOps is data-driven with portable configurations that enable deterministic execution across multiple environments.

  The Microsoft Security DevOps uses the following Open Source tools:

  > [!NOTE]
  > Effective September 20, 2023, the secrets scanning (CredScan) tool within the Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO) Extension for Azure DevOps has been deprecated. MSDO secrets scanning will be replaced with [GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/github-advanced-security).

prerequisites:
  summary: |
    - Project Collection Administrator privileges to the Azure DevOps organization are required to install the extension.

    If you don't have access to install the extension, you must request access from your Azure DevOps organization's administrator during the installation process.

        To commit the pipeline, select **Save and run**.

        The pipeline will run for a few minutes and save the results.

        > [!NOTE]

      Uploading findings from third-party security tooling into Defender for Cloud
    summary: |
      While Defender for Cloud provides the MSDO CLI for standardized
      functionality and policy controls across a set of open source security
      analyzers, you have the flexibility to upload results from other
      third-party security tooling that you might have configured in CI/CD
      pipelines to Defender for Cloud for comprehensive code-to-cloud
      contextualization. All results uploaded to Defender for Cloud must be in
      standard SARIF format.

      First, ensure your Azure DevOps repositories are
      [onboarded to Defender for Cloud](quickstart-onboard-devops.md). After
      you successfully onboard Defender for Cloud, it continuously monitors the
      'CodeAnalysisLogs' artifact for SARIF output.

      You can use the 'PublishBuildArtifacts@1' task to ensure SARIF output is
      published to the correct artifact. For example, if a security analyzer
      outputs `results.sarif`, you can configure the following task in your job
      to ensure results are uploaded to Defender for Cloud:
    code: |
        ```yml
        - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
          inputs:
            PathtoPublish: 'results.sarif'
            ArtifactName: 'CodeAnalysisLogs'
        ```

        Findings from third-party security tools will appear as 'Azure DevOps
        repositories should have code scanning findings resolved' assessments
        associated with the repository the security finding was identified in.
