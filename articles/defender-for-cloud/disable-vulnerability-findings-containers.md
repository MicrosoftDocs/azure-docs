# Create exemptions and disable vulnerability assessment findings on Container registry images and running images

>[!NOTE]
>You can customize your vulnerability assessment experience by exempting management groups, subscriptions, or specific resources from your secure score. Learn how to [create an exemption](exempt-resource.md) for a resource or subscription.

If you have an organizational need to ignore a finding, rather than remediate it, you can optionally disable it. Disabled findings don't affect your secure score or generate unwanted noise.

When a finding matches the criteria you've defined in your disable rules, it doesn't appear in the list of findings. Typical scenario examples include:

- Disable findings with severity below medium
- Disable findings for images that the vendor will not fix

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To create a rule, you need permissions to edit a policy in Azure Policy.
> Learn more in [Azure RBAC permissions in Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md#azure-rbac-permissions-in-azure-policy).

You can use a combination of any of the following criteria:

- **CVE** - Enter the CVEs of the findings you want to exclude. Ensure the CVEs are valid. Separate multiple CVEs with a semicolon. For example, CVE-2020-1347; CVE-2020-1346.
- **Image digest** - Specify images for which vulnerabilities should be excluded based on the image digest. Separate multiple digests with a semicolon, for example: `sha256:9b920e938111710c2768b31699aac9d1ae80ab6284454e8a9ff42e887fa1db31;sha256:ab0ab32f75988da9b146de7a3589c47e919393ae51bbf2d8a0d55dd92542451c`
- **OS version** - Specify images for which vulnerabilities should be excluded based on the image OS. Separate multiple versions with a semicolon, for example: ubuntu_linux_20.04;alpine_3.17
- **Minimum Severity** - Select low, medium, high, or critical to exclude vulnerabilities less than and equal to the specified severity level.
- **Fix status** - Select the option to exclude vulnerabilities based on their fix status.

Disable rules apply per recommendation, for example, to disable [CVE-2017-17512](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fc69-2v7r-7r95) both on the registry images and runtime images, the disable rule has to be configured in both places.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](//azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.  

 To create a rule:

1. From the recommendations detail page for [Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5) or [Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management
](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c609cf0f-71ab-41e9-a3c6-9a1f7fe1b8d5), select **Disable rule**.

1. Select the relevant scope.

1. Define your criteria. You can use any of the following criteria:

    - **CVE** - Enter the CVEs of the findings you want to exclude. Ensure the CVEs are valid. Separate multiple CVEs with a semicolon. For example, CVE-2020-1347; CVE-2020-1346.
    - **Image digest** - Specify images for which vulnerabilities should be excluded based on the image digest. Separate multiple digests with a semicolon, for example: sha256:9b920e938111710c2768b31699aac9d1ae80ab6284454e8a9ff42e887fa1db31;sha256:ab0ab32f75988da9b146de7a3589c47e919393ae51bbf2d8a0d55dd92542451c
    - **OS version** - Specify images for which vulnerabilities should be excluded based on the image OS. Separate multiple versions with a semicolon, for example: ubuntu_linux_20.04;alpine_3.17
    - **Minimum Severity** - Select low, medium, high, or critical to exclude vulnerabilities less than and equal to the specified severity level.
    - **Fix status** - Select the option to exclude vulnerabilities based on their fix status.

1. In the justification text box, add your justification for why a specific vulnerability was disabled. This provides clarity and understanding for anyone reviewing the rule.

1. Select **Apply rule**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Changes might take up to 24 hours to take effect.

**To view, override, or delete a rule:**

1. From the recommendations detail page, select **Disable rule**.
1. From the scope list, subscriptions with active rules show as **Rule applied**.
1. To view or delete the rule, select the ellipsis menu ("...").
1. Do one of the following:
    - To view or override a disable rule - select **View rule**, make any changes you want, and select **Override rule**.
    - To delete a disable rule - select **Delete rule**.
