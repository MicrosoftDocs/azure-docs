# Enable vulnerability assessment in Azure powered by MDVM

Vulnerability assessment for Azure, powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM), is an out-of-box solution that empowers security teams to easily discover and remediate vulnerabilities in Linux container images, with zero configuration for onboarding, and without deployment of any agents.

## How to enable vulnerability assessment in Azure powered by MDVM

1. Before starting, verify that the subscription is [onboarded to Defender CSPM](tutorial-enable-cspm-plan.md), [Defender for Containers](tutorial-enable-containers-azure.md) or [Defender for Container Registries](defender-for-container-registries-introduction.md).
1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Defender for Cloud's **Environment Settings** page.

1. Select the subscription that's onboarded to one of the above plans. Then select **Settings**.

1. Ensure the **Container registries vulnerability assessments** extension is toggled to **On**.

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Select **Save**.

A notification message pops up in the top right corner that will verify that the settings were saved successfully.

## How to enable runtime coverage

- For Defender for CSPM, use agentless discovery for Kubernetes. For more information, see [Onboard agentless container posture in Defender CSPM](how-to-enable-agentless-containers.md).
- For Defender for Containers, use the Defender for Containers agent. For more information, see [Deploy the Defender profile in Azure](tutorial-enable-containers-azure.md#deploy-the-defender-profile-in-azure).
- For Defender for Container Registries, there is no runtime coverage.
