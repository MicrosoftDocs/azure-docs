# Investigate weaknesses with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's threat and vulnerability management 

[Microsoft's threat and vulnerability management](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt) is a built-in module in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint that can:

- Discover vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in near real time
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on the threat landscape and detections in your organization

If you've enabled the [integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md), you'll automatically get the threat and vulnerability management findings without the need for additional agents.

As it's a built-in module for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, **threat and vulnerability management** doesn't require periodic scans.

For a quick overview of threat and vulnerability management, watch this video:

## Onboarding your machines to threat and vulnerability management

The integration between Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for Cloud takes place in the background, so it doesn't involve any changes at the endpoint level.

- **To manually onboard one or more machines** to threat and vulnerability management, use the security recommendation "[Machines should have a vulnerability assessment solution](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/ffff0522-1e88-47fc-8382-2a80ba848f5d)":

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-tvm/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-solutions.png" alt-text="Selecting a vulnerability assessment solution from the recommendation.":::

- **To automatically find and view the vulnerabilities** on existing and new machines without the need to manually remediate the preceding recommendation, see [Automatically configure vulnerability assessment for your machines](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md).

- **To onboard via the REST API**, run PUT/DELETE using this URL: `https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/.../providers/Microsoft.Security/serverVulnerabilityAssessments/mdetvm?api-version=2015-06-01-preview`


The findings for **all** vulnerability assessment tools are in the Defender for Cloud recommendation **Vulnerabilities in your virtual machines should be remediated**.
