# Security alerts - a reference guide

This article lists the security alerts you might get from Microsoft Defender for Cloud and any Microsoft Defender plans you've enabled. The alerts shown in your environment depend on the resources and services you're protecting, and your customized configuration.

At the bottom of this page, there's a table describing the Microsoft Defender for Cloud kill chain aligned with version 9 of the [MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/).

[Learn how to respond to these alerts](managing-and-responding-alerts.md).

[Learn how to export alerts](continuous-export.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts from different sources might take different amounts of time to appear. For example, alerts that require analysis of network traffic might take longer to appear than alerts related to suspicious processes running on virtual machines.

## <a name="alerts-k8scluster"></a>Alerts for containers - Kubernetes clusters

Microsoft Defender for Containers provides security alerts on the cluster level and on the underlying cluster nodes by monitoring both control plane (API server) and the containerized workload itself. Control plane security alerts can be recognized by a prefix of `K8S_` of the alert type. Security alerts for runtime workload in the clusters can be recognized by the `K8S.NODE_` prefix of the alert type. All alerts are supported on Linux only, unless otherwise indicated.

| Alert (alert type) | Description | MITRE tactics<br>([Learn more](#intentions)) | Severity |
|--|--|:-:|--|
| **Exposed Postgres service with trust authentication configuration in Kubernetes detected (Preview)**<br>(K8S_ExposedPostgresTrustAuth)|Kubernetes cluster configuration analysis detected exposure of a Postgres service by a load balancer. The service is configured with trust authentication method, which doesn't require credentials.|InitialAccess|Medium|
| **Exposed Postgres service with risky configuration in Kubernetes detected (Preview)**<br>(K8S_ExposedPostgresBroadIPRange)|Kubernetes cluster configuration analysis detected exposure of a Postgres service by a load balancer with a risky configuration. Exposing the service to a wide range of IP addresses poses a security risk.|InitialAccess|Medium|
| **Attempt to create a new Linux namespace from a container detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_NamespaceCreation) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container in Kubernetes cluster detected an attempt to create a new Linux namespace. While this behavior might be legitimate, it might indicate that an attacker tries to escape from the container to the node. Some CVE-2022-0185 exploitations use this technique. | PrivilegeEscalation | Medium |
| **A history file has been cleared**<br>(K8S.NODE_HistoryFileCleared) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected that the command history log file has been cleared. Attackers may do this to cover their tracks. The operation was performed by the specified user account. | DefenseEvasion | Medium |
| **Abnormal activity of managed identity associated with Kubernetes (Preview)**<br>(K8S_AbnormalMiActivity) | Analysis of Azure Resource Manager operations detected an abnormal behavior of a managed identity used by an AKS addon. The detected activity isn\'t consistent with the behavior of the associated addon. While this activity can be legitimate, such behavior might indicate that the identity was gained by an attacker, possibly from a compromised container in the Kubernetes cluster. | Lateral Movement | Medium |
| **Abnormal Kubernetes service account operation detected**<br>(K8S_ServiceAccountRareOperation) | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected abnormal behavior by a service account in your Kubernetes cluster. The service account was used for an operation which isn't common for this service account. While this activity can be legitimate, such behavior might indicate that the service account is being used for malicious purposes. | Lateral Movement, Credential Access | Medium |
| **An uncommon connection attempt detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_SuspectConnection) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected an uncommon connection attempt utilizing a socks protocol. This is very rare in normal operations, but a known technique for attackers attempting to bypass network-layer detections. | Execution, Exfiltration, Exploitation | Medium |
| **Anomalous pod deployment (Preview)**<br>(K8S_AnomalousPodDeployment) <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected pod deployment which is anomalous based on previous pod deployment activity. This activity is considered an anomaly when taking into account how the different features seen in the deployment operation are in relations to one another. The features monitored include the container image registry used, the account performing the deployment, day of the week, how often this account performs pod deployments, user agent used in the operation, whether this is a namespace to which pod deployments often occur, and other features. Top contributing reasons for raising this alert as anomalous activity are detailed under the alert's extended properties. | Execution | Medium |
| **Anomalous secret access (Preview)**<br>(K8S_AnomalousSecretAccess) <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected secret access request which is anomalous based on previous secret access activity. This activity is considered an anomaly when taking into account how the different features seen in the secret access operation are in relations to one another. The features monitored by this analytics include the user name used, the name of the secret, the name of the namespace, user agent used in the operation, or other features. Top contributing reasons for raising this alert as anomalous activity are detailed under the alert extended properties. | CredentialAccess | Medium |
| **Attempt to stop apt-daily-upgrade.timer service detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_TimerServiceDisabled) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected an attempt to stop apt-daily-upgrade.timer service. Attackers have been observed stopping this service to download malicious files and grant execution privileges for their attacks. This activity can also happen if the service is updated through normal administrative actions. | DefenseEvasion | Informational |
| **Behavior similar to common Linux bots detected (Preview)**<br>(K8S.NODE_CommonBot) | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected the execution of a process normally associated with common Linux botnets. | Execution, Collection, Command And Control | Medium |
| **Behavior similar to Fairware ransomware detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_FairwareMalware) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container detected the execution of rm -rf commands applied to suspicious locations. As rm -rf will recursively delete files, it is normally used on discrete folders. In this case, it is being used in a location that could remove a lot of data. Fairware ransomware is known to execute rm -rf commands in this folder. | Execution | Medium |
| **Command within a container running with high privileges**<br>(K8S.NODE_PrivilegedExecutionInContainer) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Machine logs indicate that a privileged command was run in a Docker container. A privileged command has extended privileges on the host machine. | PrivilegeEscalation | Low |
| **Container running in privileged mode**<br>(K8S.NODE_PrivilegedContainerArtifacts) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected the execution of a Docker command that is running a privileged container. The privileged container has full access to the hosting pod or host resource. If compromised, an attacker may use the privileged container to gain access to the hosting pod or host. | PrivilegeEscalation, Execution | Low |
| **Container with a sensitive volume mount detected**<br>(K8S_SensitiveMount) | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new container with a sensitive volume mount. The volume that was detected is a hostPath type which mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount for gaining access to the node. | Privilege Escalation | Medium |
| **CoreDNS modification in Kubernetes detected**<br>(K8S_CoreDnsModification) <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a modification of the CoreDNS configuration. The configuration of CoreDNS can be modified by overriding its configmap. While this activity can be legitimate, if attackers have permissions to modify the configmap, they can change the behavior of the cluster's DNS server and poison it. | Lateral Movement | Low |
| **Creation of admission webhook configuration detected**<br>(K8S_AdmissionController) <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new admission webhook configuration. Kubernetes has two built-in generic admission controllers: MutatingAdmissionWebhook and ValidatingAdmissionWebhook. The behavior of these admission controllers is determined by an admission webhook that the user deploys to the cluster. The usage of such admission controllers can be legitimate, however attackers can use such webhooks for modifying the requests (in case of MutatingAdmissionWebhook) or inspecting the requests and gain sensitive information (in case of ValidatingAdmissionWebhook). | Credential Access, Persistence | Low |
| **Detected file download from a known malicious source**<br>(K8S.NODE_SuspectDownload) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected a download of a file from a source frequently used to distribute malware. | PrivilegeEscalation, Execution, Exfiltration, Command And Control | Medium |

| **Digital currency mining related behavior detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_DigitalCurrencyMining) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected an execution of a process or command normally associated with digital currency mining. | Execution | High |
| **Docker build operation detected on a Kubernetes node**<br>(K8S.NODE_ImageBuildOnNode) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected a build operation of a container image on a Kubernetes node. While this behavior might be legitimate, attackers might build their malicious images locally to avoid detection. | DefenseEvasion | Low |
| **Excessive role permissions assigned in Kubernetes cluster (Preview)**<br>(K8S_ServiceAcountPermissionAnomaly) <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> | Analysis of the Kubernetes audit logs detected an excessive permissions role assignment to your cluster. The listed permissions for the assigned roles are uncommon to the specific service account. This detection considers previous role assignments to the same service account across clusters monitored by Azure, volume per permission, and the impact of the specific permission. The anomaly detection model used for this alert takes into account how this permission is used across all clusters monitored by Microsoft Defender for Cloud. | Privilege Escalation | Low |
| **Executable found running from a suspicious location (Preview)**<br>(K8S.NODE_SuspectExecutablePath) | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected an executable file that is running from a location associated with known suspicious files. This executable could either be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised system. | Execution | Medium |
| **Exposed Kubeflow dashboard detected**<br>(K8S_ExposedKubeflow)  | The Kubernetes audit log analysis detected exposure of the Istio Ingress by a load balancer in a cluster that runs Kubeflow. This action might expose the Kubeflow dashboard to the internet. If the dashboard is exposed to the internet, attackers can access it and run malicious containers or code on the cluster. Find more details in the following article: https://aka.ms/exposedkubeflow-blog | Initial Access | Medium |
| **Exposed Kubernetes dashboard detected**<br>(K8S_ExposedDashboard) | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected exposure of the Kubernetes Dashboard by a LoadBalancer service. Exposed dashboard allows an unauthenticated access to the cluster management and poses a security threat. | Initial Access | High |
| **Exposed Kubernetes service detected**<br>(K8S_ExposedService)  | The Kubernetes audit log analysis detected exposure of a service by a load balancer. This service is related to a sensitive application that allows high impact operations in the cluster such as running processes on the node or creating new containers. In some cases, this service doesn't require authentication. If the service doesn't require authentication, exposing it to the internet poses a security risk. | Initial Access | Medium |
| **Exposed Redis service in AKS detected**<br>(K8S_ExposedRedis) | The Kubernetes audit log analysis detected exposure of a Redis service by a load balancer. If the service doesn't require authentication, exposing it to the internet poses a security risk. | Initial Access | Low |
| **Indicators associated with DDOS toolkit detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_KnownLinuxDDoSToolkit) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected file names that are part of a toolkit associated with malware capable of launching DDoS attacks, opening ports and services, and taking full control over the infected system. This could also possibly be legitimate activity. | Persistence, LateralMovement, Execution, Exploitation | Medium |
| **K8S API requests from proxy IP address detected**<br>(K8S_TI_Proxy) <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected API requests to your cluster from an IP address that is associated with proxy services, such as TOR. While this behavior can be legitimate, it's often seen in malicious activities, when attackers try to hide their source IP. | Execution | Low |
| **Kubernetes events deleted**<br>(K8S_DeleteEvents) <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> | Defender for Cloud detected that some Kubernetes events have been deleted. Kubernetes events are objects in Kubernetes which contain information about changes in the cluster. Attackers might delete those events for hiding their operations in the cluster. | Defense Evasion | Low |
| **Kubernetes penetration testing tool detected**<br>(K8S_PenTestToolsKubeHunter)  | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected usage of Kubernetes penetration testing tool in the AKS cluster. While this behavior can be legitimate, attackers might use such public tools for malicious purposes. | Execution | Low |

| **Digital currency mining activity**<br>(K8S.NODE_CurrencyMining) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of DNS transactions detected digital currency mining activity. Such activity, while possibly legitimate user behavior, is frequently performed by attackers following compromise of resources. Typical related attacker activity is likely to include the download and execution of common mining tools. | Exfiltration | Low |
| **Access to kubelet kubeconfig file detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_KubeConfigAccess) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running on a Kubernetes cluster node detected access to kubeconfig file on the host. The kubeconfig file, normally used by the Kubelet process, contains credentials to the Kubernetes cluster API server. Access to this file is often associated with attackers attempting to access those credentials, or with security scanning tools which check if the file is accessible. | CredentialAccess | Medium |
| **Access to cloud metadata service detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_ImdsCall) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container detected access to the cloud metadata service for acquiring identity token. The container doesn't normally perform such operation. While this behavior might be legitimate, attackers might use this technique to access cloud resources after gaining initial access to a running container. | CredentialAccess | Medium |
| **MITRE Caldera agent detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_MitreCalderaTools) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected a suspicious process.

|**Suspicious external access to an Azure storage account with overly permissive SAS token (Preview)**<br>Storage.Blob_AccountSas.InternalSasUsedExternally|  The alert indicates that someone with an external (public) IP address accessed the storage account using an overly permissive SAS token with a long expiration date. This type of access is considered suspicious because the SAS token is typically only used in internal networks (from private IP addresses). <br>The activity may indicate that a SAS token has been leaked by a malicious actor or leaked unintentionally from a legitimate source. <br>Even if the access is legitimate, using a high-permission SAS token with a long expiration date goes against security best practices and poses a potential security risk. <br>Applies to: Azure Blob (Standard general-purpose v2, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or premium block blobs) storage accounts with the new Defender for Storage plan.   |  Exfiltration /  Resource Development / Impact   |  Medium |
|**Suspicious external operation to an Azure storage account with overly permissive SAS token (Preview)**<br>Storage.Blob_AccountSas.UnusualOperationFromExternalIp|  The alert indicates that someone with an external (public) IP address accessed the storage account using an overly permissive SAS token with a long expiration date. The access is considered suspicious because operations invoked outside your network (not from private IP addresses) with this SAS token are typically used for a specific set of Read/Write/Delete operations, but other operations occurred, which makes this access suspicious. <br>This activity may indicate that a SAS token has been leaked by a malicious actor or leaked unintentionally from a legitimate source. <br>Even if the access is legitimate, using a high-permission SAS token with a long expiration date goes against security best practices and poses a potential security risk. <br>Applies to: Azure Blob (Standard general-purpose v2, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or premium block blobs) storage accounts with the new Defender for Storage plan.   |  Exfiltration /  Resource Development / Impact   |  Medium |
|**Unusual SAS token was used to access an Azure storage account from a public IP address (Preview)**<br>Storage.Blob_AccountSas.UnusualExternalAccess|  The alert indicates that someone with an external (public) IP address has accessed the storage account using an account SAS token. The access is highly unusual and considered suspicious, as access to the storage account using SAS tokens typically comes only from internal (private) IP addresses. <br>It's possible that a SAS token was leaked or generated by a malicious actor either from within your organization or externally to gain access to this storage account. <br>Applies to: Azure Blob (Standard general-purpose v2, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or premium block blobs) storage accounts with the new Defender for Storage plan.   |  Exfiltration /  Resource Development / Impact   |  Low         |

| Alert (alert type)| Description | MITRE tactics<br>([Learn more](#intentions)) | Severity |
|--|--|:-:|--|
| **Access from a Tor exit node** <br> (CosmosDB_TorAnomaly)  | This Azure Cosmos DB account was successfully accessed from an IP address known to be an active exit node of Tor, an anonymizing proxy. Authenticated access from a Tor exit node is a likely indication that a threat actor is trying to hide their identity. | Initial Access | High/Medium |
| **Access from a suspicious IP**<br>(CosmosDB_SuspiciousIp) | This Azure Cosmos DB account was successfully accessed from an IP address that was identified as a threat by Microsoft Threat Intelligence. | Initial Access  | Medium |
| **Access from an unusual location**<br>(CosmosDB_GeoAnomaly) | This Azure Cosmos DB account was accessed from a location considered unfamiliar, based on the usual access pattern. <br><br> Either a threat actor has gained access to the account, or a legitimate user has connected from a new or unusual geographic location | Initial Access | Low |
| **Unusual volume of data extracted**<br>(CosmosDB_DataExfiltrationAnomaly) | An unusually large volume of data has been extracted from this Azure Cosmos DB account. This might indicate that a threat actor exfiltrated data. | Exfiltration | Medium |
| **Extraction of Azure Cosmos DB accounts keys via a potentially malicious script**<br>(CosmosDB_SuspiciousListKeys.MaliciousScript) | A PowerShell script was run in your subscription and performed a suspicious pattern of key-listing operations to get the keys of Azure Cosmos DB accounts in your subscription. Threat actors use automated scripts, like Microburst, to list keys and find Azure Cosmos DB accounts they can access. <br><br> This operation might indicate that an identity in your organization was breached, and that the threat actor is trying to compromise Azure Cosmos DB accounts in your environment for malicious intentions. <br><br> Alternatively, a malicious insider could be trying to access sensitive data and perform lateral movement. | Collection | High |
| **Suspicious extraction of Azure Cosmos DB account keys** (AzureCosmosDB_SuspiciousListKeys.SuspiciousPrincipal) | A suspicious source extracted Azure Cosmos DB account access keys from your subscription. If this source is not a legitimate source, this may be a high impact issue. The access key that was extracted provides full control over the associated databases and the data stored within. See the details of each specific alert to understand why the source was flagged as suspicious. | Credential Access | high | 
| **SQL injection: potential data exfiltration**<br>(CosmosDB_SqlInjection.DataExfiltration) | A suspicious SQL statement was used to query a container in this Azure Cosmos DB account. <br><br> The injected statement might have succeeded in exfiltrating data that the threat actor isn't authorized to access. <br><br> Due to the structure and capabilities of Azure Cosmos DB queries, many known SQL injection attacks on Azure Cosmos DB accounts cannot work. However, the variation used in this attack may work and threat actors can exfiltrate data. | Exfiltration  | Medium |
| **SQL injection: fuzzing attempt**<br>(CosmosDB_SqlInjection.FailedFuzzingAttempt) | A suspicious SQL statement was used to query a container in this Azure Cosmos DB account. <br><br> Like other well-known SQL injection attacks, this attack won't succeed in compromising the Azure Cosmos DB account. <br><br> Nevertheless, it's an indication that a threat actor is trying to attack the resources in this account, and your application may be compromised. <br><br> Some SQL injection attacks can succeed and be used to exfiltrate data. This means that if the attacker continues performing SQL injection attempts, they may be able to compromise your Azure Cosmos DB account and exfiltrate data. <br><br> You can prevent this threat by using parameterized queries. | Pre-attack  | Low |

When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected activity might indicate that one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway) has communicated with what is possibly a Command and Control center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Command and Control                          | Medium   |
| **Possible compromised machine detected**<br>(Network_ResourceIpIndicatedAsMalicious)                 | Threat intelligence indicates that your machine (at IP %{Machine IP}) may have been compromised by a malware of type Conficker. Conficker was a computer worm that targets the Microsoft Windows operating system and was first detected in November 2008. Conficker infected millions of computers including government, business and home computers in over 200 countries/regions, making it the largest known computer worm infection since the 2003 Welchia worm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Command and Control                          | Medium   |
| **Possible incoming %{Service Name} brute force attempts detected**<br>(Generic_Incoming_BF_OneToOne) | Network traffic analysis detected incoming %{Service Name} communication to %{Victim IP}, associated with your resource %{Compromised Host} from %{Attacker IP}. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected incoming traffic has been forwarded to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows suspicious activity between %{Start Time} and %{End Time} on port %{Victim Port}. This activity is consistent with brute force attempts against %{Service Name} servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | PreAttack                                    | Medium   |

When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected incoming traffic has been forwarded to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows suspicious activity between %{Start Time} and %{End Time} on port %{Port Number} (%{SQL Service Type}). This activity is consistent with brute force attempts against SQL servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | PreAttack                                    | Medium   |
| **Possible outgoing denial-of-service attack detected**<br>(DDOS)                                     | Network traffic analysis detected anomalous outgoing activity originating from %{Compromised Host}, a resource in your deployment. This activity may indicate that your resource was compromised and is now engaged in denial-of-service attacks against external endpoints. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected activity might indicate that one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway) was compromised. Based on the volume of connections, we believe that the following IPs are possibly the targets of the DOS attack: %{Possible Victims}.  Note that it is possible that the communication to some of these IPs is legitimate.                                                                                                         | Impact                                       | Medium   |
| **Suspicious incoming RDP network activity from multiple sources**<br>(RDP_Incoming_BF_ManyToOne)     | Network traffic analysis detected anomalous incoming Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) communication to %{Victim IP}, associated with your resource %{Compromised Host}, from multiple sources. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected incoming traffic has been forwarded to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows %{Number of Attacking IPs} unique IPs connecting to your resource, which is considered abnormal for this environment. This activity may indicate an attempt to brute force your RDP end point from multiple hosts (Botnet)                                                                                                                                                        | PreAttack                                    | Medium   |

## MITRE ATT&CK tactics

Understanding the intention of an attack can help you investigate and report the event more easily. To help with these efforts, Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts include the MITRE tactics with many alerts.

The series of steps that describe the progression of a cyberattack from reconnaissance to data exfiltration is often referred to as a "kill chain". 

Defender for Cloud's supported kill chain intents are based on [version 9 of the MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/) and described in the table below.

| Tactic                   | ATT&CK Version    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PreAttack**            |     | [PreAttack](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/pre/) could be either an attempt to access a certain resource regardless of a malicious intent, or a failed attempt to gain access to a target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is usually detected as an attempt, originating from outside the network, to scan the target system and identify an entry point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Initial Access**       | V7, V9    | Initial Access is the stage where an attacker manages to get a foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is relevant for compute hosts and resources such as user accounts, certificates etc. Threat actors will often be able to control the resource after this stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Persistence**          | V7, V9    | Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a system that gives a threat actor a persistent presence on that system. Threat actors will often need to maintain access to systems through interruptions such as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures that would require a remote access tool to restart or provide an alternate backdoor for them to regain access.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Privilege Escalation** | V7, V9    | Privilege escalation is the result of actions that allow an adversary to obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or network. Certain tools or actions require a higher level of privilege to work and are likely necessary at many points throughout an operation. User accounts with permissions to access specific systems or perform specific functions necessary for adversaries to achieve their objective may also be considered an escalation of privilege.                                                                                                                        |
| **Defense Evasion**      | V7, V9    | Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are the same as (or variations of) techniques in other categories that have the added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Credential Access**    | V7, V9    | Credential access represents techniques resulting in access to or control over system, domain, or service credentials that are used within an enterprise environment. Adversaries will likely attempt to obtain legitimate credentials from users or administrator accounts (local system administrator or domain users with administrator access) to use within the network. With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create accounts for later use within the environment.                                                                                                      |
| **Discovery**            | V7, V9    | Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides many native tools that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase.                                                                                                                                    |
| **LateralMovement**      | V7, V9    | Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The lateral movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information from a system without needing more tools, such as a remote access tool. An adversary can use lateral movement for many purposes, including remote Execution of tools, pivoting to more systems, access to specific information or files, access to more credentials, or to cause an effect. |
| **Execution**            | V7, V9    | The execution tactic represents techniques that result in execution of adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system. This tactic is often used in conjunction with lateral movement to expand access to remote systems on a network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Collection**           | V7, V9    | Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Command and Control**  | V7, V9    | The command and control tactic represents how adversaries communicate with systems under their control within a target network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Exfiltration**         | V7, V9    | Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the adversary removing files and information from a target network. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Impact**               | V7, V9    | Impact events primarily try to directly reduce the availability or integrity of a system, service, or network; including manipulation of data to impact a business or operational process. This would often refer to techniques such as ransomware, defacement, data manipulation, and others.
