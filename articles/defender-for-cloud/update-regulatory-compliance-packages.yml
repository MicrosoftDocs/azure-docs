  Assign security standards
introduction: |
  Defender for Cloud's regulatory standards and benchmarks are represented as [security standards](security-policy-concept.md). Each standard is an initiative defined in Azure Policy.

  In Defender for Cloud, you assign security standards to specific scopes such as Azure subscriptions, AWS accounts, and GCP projects that have Defender for Cloud enabled.

  Defender for Cloud continually assesses the environment-in-scope against standards. Based on assessments, it shows in-scope resources as being compliant or noncompliant with the standard, and provides remediation recommendations.

  This article describes how to add regulatory compliance standards as security standards in an Azure subscription, AWS account, or GCP project.
prerequisites:
  summary: |  
    - To add compliance standards, at least one Defender for Cloud plan must be enabled.
    - You need `Owner` or `Policy Contributor` permissions to add a standard.

      - |
        Select an account or management account (Azure subscription or management group, AWS account or management account, GCP project or organization) on which you want to assign the security standard.

          > [!NOTE]
          > We recommend selecting the highest scope for which the standard is applicable so that compliance data is aggregated and tracked for all nested resources.
      - |
        Select **Security policies**.
      - | 
        Locate the standard you want to enable and toggle the status to **On**.

        If any information is needed in order to enable the standard, the **Set parameters** page appears for you to type in the information.

        The selected standard appears in **Regulatory compliance** dashboard as enabled for the subscription it was enabled on.
