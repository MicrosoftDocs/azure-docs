# Common alert schema

The common alert schema standardizes the consumption of Azure Monitor alert notifications. Historically, activity log, metric, and log alerts each had their own email templates and webhook schemas. The common alert schema provides one standardized schema for all alert notifications. 

Using a standardized schema helps minimize the number of integrations, which simplifies the process of managing and maintaining your integrations. The common schema enables a richer alert consumption experience in both the Azure portal and the Azure mobile app.

The common alert schema provides a consistent structure for:
- **Email templates**: Use the detailed email template to diagnose issues at a glance. Embedded links to the alert instance on the portal and to the affected resource ensure that you can quickly jump into the remediation process. 
- **JSON structure**: Use the consistent JSON structure to build integrations for all alert types using:
    - Azure Logic Apps
    - Azure Functions
    - Azure Automation runbook

> [!NOTE]
> - Alerts generated by [VM insights](../vm/vminsights-overview.md) do not support the common schema.
>-  Smart detection alerts use the common schema by default. You don't have to enable the common schema for smart detection alerts.

## Structure of the common schema 

The common schema includes information about the affected resource and the cause of the alert in these sections:
- **Essentials**: Standardized fields, used by all alert types that describe the resource affected by the alert and common alert metadata, such as severity or description.

    If you want to route alert instances to specific teams based on criteria such as a resource group, you can use the fields in the **Essentials** section to provide routing logic for all alert types. The teams that receive the alert notification can then use the context fields for their investigation.
- **Alert context**: Fields that vary depending on the type of the alert. The alert context fields describe the cause of the alert. For example, a metric alert would have fields like the metric name and metric value in the alert context. An activity log alert would have information about the event that generated the alert.
- **Custom properties**: Additional information that is not included in the alert payload by default can be included in the alert payload using custom properties. Custom properties are a **Key:Value** pair that can include any information configured in the alert rule.

## Essentials fields

| Field | Description|
|:---|:---|
| alertId | The unique resource ID that identifies the alert instance. |
| alertRule | The name of the alert rule that generated the alert instance. |
| Severity | The severity of the alert. Possible values are Sev0, Sev1, Sev2, Sev3, or Sev4. |
| signalType | Identifies the signal on which the alert rule was defined. Possible values are Metric, Log, or Activity Log. |
| monitorCondition | When an alert fires, the alert's monitor condition is set to **Fired**. When the underlying condition that caused the alert to fire clears, the monitor condition is set to **Resolved**.   |
| monitoringService | The monitoring service or solution that generated the alert. The monitoring service determines which fields are in the alert context. |
| alertTargetIDs | The list of the Azure Resource Manager IDs that are affected targets of an alert. For a log alert defined on a Log Analytics workspace or Application Insights instance, it's the respective workspace or application. |
| configurationItems |The list of affected resources of an alert.<br>In some cases, the configuration items can be different from the alert targets. For example, in metric-for-log or log alerts defined on a Log Analytics workspace, the configuration items are the actual resources sending the data, and not the workspace.<br><ul><li>In the log alerts API (Scheduled Query Rules) v2021-08-01, the `configurationItem` values are taken from explicitly defined dimensions in this priority: `_ResourceId`, `ResourceId`, `Resource`, `Computer`.</li><li>In earlier versions of the log alerts API, the `configurationItem` values are taken implicitly from the results in this priority: `_ResourceId`, `ResourceId`, `Resource`, `Computer`.</li></ul>In ITSM systems, the `configurationItems` field is used to correlate alerts to resources in a configuration management database. |
| originAlertId | The ID of the alert instance, as generated by the monitoring service generating it. |
| firedDateTime | The date and time when the alert instance was fired in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). |
| resolvedDateTime | The date and time when the monitor condition for the alert instance is set to **Resolved** in UTC. Currently only applicable for metric alerts.|
| description | The description, as defined in the alert rule. |
|essentialsVersion| The version number for the essentials section.|
|alertContextVersion | The version number for the `alertContext` section. |

## Alert context fields for Log alerts

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable the common schema, the fields in the payload are reset to the common schema fields. Therefore, log alerts have these limitations regarding the common schema:
> - The common schema is not supported for log alerts using webhooks with a custom email subject and/or JSON payload, since the common schema overwrites the custom configurations.
> - Alerts using the common schema have an upper size limit of 256 KB per alert. If the log alerts payload includes search results that cause the alert to exceed the maximum size, the search results aren't embedded in the log alerts payload. You can check if the payload includes the search results with the `IncludedSearchResults` flag. Use `LinkToFilteredSearchResultsAPI` or `LinkToSearchResultsAPI` to access query results with the [Log Analytics API](/rest/api/loganalytics/dataaccess/query/get) if the search results are not included.

|ResultCount     |The number of records returned by the query. For metric measurement rules, the number or records that match the specific dimension combination.          |
|LinkToSearchResults     |A link to the search results.         |
|LinkToFilteredSearchResultsUI    |For metric measurement rules, the link to the search results after they've been filtered by the dimension combinations.         |
|LinkToSearchResultsAPI     |A link to the query results using the Log Analytics API.          |
|LinkToFilteredSearchResultsAPI     |For metric measurement rules, the link to the search results using the Log Analytics API after they've been filtered by the dimension combinations.         |

### Sample log alert when the monitoringService = Log Alerts V2

> [!NOTE]
> Log alert rules from API version 2020-05-01 use this payload type, which only supports common schema. Search results aren't embedded in the log alerts payload when you use this version. Use [dimensions](./alerts-unified-log.md#split-by-alert-dimensions) to provide context to fired alerts. You can also use `LinkToFilteredSearchResultsAPI` or `LinkToSearchResultsAPI` to access query results with the [Log Analytics API](/rest/api/loganalytics/dataaccess/query/get). If you must embed the results, use a logic app with the provided links to generate a custom payload.

## Alert context fields for Prometheus alerts

See [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus rule groups (preview)](../essentials/prometheus-rule-groups.md) for detailed information about the fields in Prometheus alerts.
### Sample Prometheus alert

```json
{
  "alertContext": {
    "interval": "PT1M",
    "expression": "sql_up > 0",
    "expressionValue": "0",
    "for": "PT2M",
    "labels": {
      "Environment": "Prod",
      "cluster": "myCluster1"
    },
    "annotations": {
      "summary": "alert on SQL availability"
    },
    "ruleGroup": "/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.AlertsManagement/prometheusRuleGroups/myRuleGroup"
  }
}
```
## Custom properties fields

If the alert rule that generated your alert contains action groups, custom properties can contain additional information about the alert. The custom properties section contains “key: value” objects that are added to webhook notifications. 

If custom properties aren't set in the alert rule, the field is null.
## Enable the common alert schema

Use action groups in the Azure portal or use the REST API to enable the common alert schema. Schemas are defined at the action level. For example, you must separately enable the schema for an email action and a webhook action.

### Enable the common schema in the Azure portal

![Screenshot that shows the common alert schema opt in.](media/alerts-common-schema/portal-opt-in.png)

1. Open any existing action or a new action in an action group.
1. Select **Yes** to enable the common alert schema.
### Enable the common schema using the REST API

You can also use the [Action Groups API](/rest/api/monitor/actiongroups) to opt in to the common alert schema. In the [create or update](/rest/api/monitor/actiongroups/createorupdate) REST API call,
- Set the "useCommonAlertSchema" flag to `true` to enable the common schema
- Set the "useCommonAlertSchema" flag to `false` to use the non-common schema for email, webhook, Logic Apps, Azure Functions, or Automation runbook actions.
#### Sample REST API call for using the common schema

The following [create or update](/rest/api/monitor/actiongroups/createorupdate) REST API request:

- Enables the common alert schema for the email action "John Doe's email."
- Disables the common alert schema for the email action "Jane Smith's email."
- Enables the common alert schema for the webhook action "Sample webhook."

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "groupShortName": "sample",
    "enabled": true,
    "emailReceivers": [
      {
        "name": "John Doe's email",
        "emailAddress": "johndoe@email.com",
        "useCommonAlertSchema": true
      },
      {
        "name": "Jane Smith's email",
        "emailAddress": "janesmith@email.com",
        "useCommonAlertSchema": false
      }
    ],
    "smsReceivers": [
      {
        "name": "John Doe's mobile",

      },
      {
        "name": "Jane Smith's mobile",
        "countryCode": "1",
        "phoneNumber": "0987654321"
      }
    ],

      {
        "name": "Sample webhook",
