> [!TIP] 
> Logs are grouped into Category groups. Category groups are a collection of different logs to help you achieve different monitoring goals.  
> The **audit** category group allows you to select the resource logs that are necessary for auditing your resource. For more information, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor Resource logs]( https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#resource-logs).
