# Simple Logs experience in Azure Monitor (Preview)
Azure Monitor provides a [rich experience](get-started-portal.md) for creating [log queries](log-query-overview.md) using the KQL language. You may not require the full power of KQL though and prefer a simplified experience for basic query requirements. The Simple Logs experience allows you to create basic queries without directly interacting with KQL. You can also use Simple Logs as a learning tool for KQL as you require more sophisticated queries.

> [!NOTE]
> Simple Logs is currently implemented as a test for only Cosmos DB and  Key Vaults. Please share your experience with Microsoft through [User Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/913690-azure-monitor) to help us determine whether we will expand and release this feature.


## Scope
The Simple Logs experience retrieves data from the *AzureDiagnostics*, *AzureMetrics*, and *AzureActivity* table for the selected resource. 

## Using Simple Logs
Navigate to any Cosmos DB or Key Vault in your Azure subscription with [diagnostic settings configured to collect logs in a Log Analytics workspace](../platform/resource-logs-collect-storage.md). Click **Logs** in the **Monitoring** menu to open the Simple Logs experience.

Click **Run** to view the query results.

## View and edit KQL
Select **Query editor** to open the KQL generated by the Simple Logs query in the full Log Analytics experience.
