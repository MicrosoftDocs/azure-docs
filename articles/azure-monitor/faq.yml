    questions:
      - question: |
          What is Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          [Azure Monitor](overview.md) is a service in Azure that provides performance and availability monitoring for applications and services in Azure, other cloud environments, or on-premises. Azure Monitor collects data from multiple sources into a common data platform where it can be analyzed for trends and anomalies. Rich features in Azure Monitor assist you in quickly identifying and responding to critical situations that might affect your application.
          
      - question: |
          What's the difference between Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights?
        answer: |
          In September 2018, Microsoft combined Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights into a single service to provide powerful end-to-end monitoring of your applications and the components they rely on. Features in Log Analytics and Application Insights haven't changed, although some features have been rebranded to Azure Monitor to better reflect their new scope. The log data engine and query language of Log Analytics is now referred to as Azure Monitor Logs. See [Azure Monitor terminology updates](terminology.md).
          
      - question: |
          What does Azure Monitor cost?
        answer: |
          Features of Azure Monitor that are automatically enabled, such as collection of metrics and activity logs, are provided at no cost. There's a cost associated with other features, such as log queries and alerting. See the [Azure Monitor pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) for detailed pricing information.
          
      - question: |
          How do I enable Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          Azure Monitor is enabled the moment that you create a new Azure subscription, and [activity log](./essentials/platform-logs-overview.md) and platform [metrics](essentials/data-platform-metrics.md) are automatically collected. Create [diagnostic settings](essentials/diagnostic-settings.md) to collect more detailed information about the operation of your Azure resources, and add [monitoring solutions](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/insights/solutions) and [insights](./monitor-reference.md) to provide extra analysis on collected data for particular services.
          
      - question: |
          How do I access Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          Access all Azure Monitor features and data from the **Monitor** menu in the Azure portal. The **Monitoring** section of the menu for different Azure services provides access to the same tools with data filtered to a particular resource. Azure Monitor data is also accessible for various scenarios by using the Azure CLI, PowerShell, and a REST API.

      - question: |
          Is there an on-premises version of Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          No. Azure Monitor is a scalable cloud service that processes and stores large amounts of data, although Azure Monitor can monitor resources that are on-premises and in other clouds.

      - question: |
          Can Azure Monitor also monitor on-premises resources?
        answer: |
          Yes. In addition to collecting monitoring data from Azure resources, Azure Monitor can collect data from virtual machines and applications in other clouds and on-premises. See [Sources of monitoring data for Azure Monitor](data-sources.md).
          
      - question: |
          Does Azure Monitor integrate with System Center Operations Manager?
        answer: |
          You can connect your existing System Center Operations Manager management group to Azure Monitor to collect data from agents into Azure Monitor Logs. This capability allows you to use log queries and solutions to analyze data collected from agents. You can also configure existing System Center Operations Manager agents to send data directly to Azure Monitor. See [Connect Operations Manager to Azure Monitor](agents/om-agents.md).
          
      - question: |
          What IP addresses does Azure Monitor use?
        answer: |
          See [IP addresses used by Application Insights and Log Analytics](app/ip-addresses.md) for a listing of the IP addresses and ports required for agents and other external resources to access Azure Monitor.
          
  - name: Monitoring data
    questions:
      - question: |
          Where does Azure Monitor get its data?
        answer: |
          Azure Monitor collects data from various sources. These sources include logs and metrics from the Azure platform and resources, custom applications, and agents running on virtual machines. Other services such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Network Watcher collect data into a Log Analytics workspace so that it can be analyzed with Azure Monitor data. You can also send custom data to Azure Monitor by using the REST API for logs or metrics. See [Sources of monitoring data for Azure Monitor](data-sources.md).
          
      - question: |
          What data does Azure Monitor collect?
        answer: |
          Azure Monitor collects data from various sources into [logs](logs/data-platform-logs.md) or [metrics](essentials/data-platform-metrics.md). Each type of data has its own relative advantages, and each supports a particular set of features in Azure Monitor. There's a single metrics database for each Azure subscription, and you can create multiple Log Analytics workspaces to collect logs depending on your requirements. See [Azure Monitor data platform](data-platform.md).
          
      - question: |
          Is there a maximum amount of data that I can collect in Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          There's no limit to the amount of metric data you can collect, but this data is stored for a maximum of 93 days. See [Retention of metrics](essentials/data-platform-metrics.md#retention-of-metrics). There's no limit on the amount of log data that you can collect, but the pricing tier you choose for the Log Analytics workspace might affect the limit. See [Pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).
          
      - question: |
          How do I access data collected by Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          Insights and solutions provide a custom experience for working with data stored in Azure Monitor. You can work directly with log data by using a log query written in Kusto Query Language (KQL). In the Azure portal, you can write and run queries and interactively analyze data by using Log Analytics. Analyze metrics in the Azure portal with the metrics explorer. See [Analyze log data in Azure Monitor](logs/log-query-overview.md) and [Get started with Azure metrics explorer](essentials/metrics-getting-started.md).
          
      - question: |
          Why am I seeing duplicate records in Azure Monitor Logs?
        answer: |
          Occasionally, you might notice duplicate records in Azure Monitor Logs. This duplication is typically from one of the following two conditions:
          
          - Components in the pipeline have retries to ensure reliable delivery at the destination. Occasionally, this capability might result in duplicates for a small percentage of telemetry items.
          - If the duplicate records come from a virtual machine, you might have both the Log Analytics agent and Azure Monitor Agent installed. If you still need the Log Analytics agent installed, configure the Log Analytics workspace to no longer collect data that's also being collected by the data collection rule used by Azure Monitor Agent.

          
  - name: Solutions and insights
    questions:
      - question: |
          What's an insight in Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          Insights provide a customized monitoring experience for particular Azure services. They use the same metrics and logs as other features in Azure Monitor but might collect extra data and provide a unique experience in the Azure portal. See [Insights in Azure Monitor](./monitor-reference.md).
          
          To view insights in the Azure portal, see the **Insights** section of the **Monitor** menu or the **Monitoring** section of the service's menu.
          
      - question: |
          What's a solution in Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          Monitoring solutions are packaged sets of logic for monitoring a particular application or service based on Azure Monitor features. They collect log data in Azure Monitor and provide log queries and views for their analysis by using a common experience in the Azure portal. See [Monitoring solutions in Azure Monitor](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/insights/solutions).
          
          To view solutions in the Azure portal, select **More** in the **Insights** section of the **Monitor** menu. Select **Add** to add more solutions to the workspace.
          
  - name: Logs
    questions:
      - question: |
          What's the difference between Azure Monitor Logs and Azure Data Explorer?
        answer: |
          Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. Azure Monitor Logs is built on top of Azure Data Explorer and uses the same Kusto Query Language (KQL) with some minor differences. See [Azure Monitor log query language differences](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/).
          
      - question: |
          How do I retrieve log data?
        answer: |
          All data is retrieved from a Log Analytics workspace by using a log query written using Kusto Query Language (KQL). You can write your own queries or use solutions and insights that include log queries for a particular application or service. See [Overview of log queries in Azure Monitor](logs/log-query-overview.md).
          
      - question: |
          Can I delete data from a Log Analytics workspace?
        answer: |
          Data is removed from a workspace according to its [retention period](logs/data-retention-archive.md). You can delete specific data for privacy or compliance reasons. See [Export and delete private data](logs/personal-data-mgmt.md#exporting-and-deleting-personal-data).
          
      - question: |
          Is Log Analytics storage immutable?
        answer: |
          Data in database storage can't be altered after it's ingested, but it can be deleted via the [Purge API path that's used for deleting private data](./logs/personal-data-mgmt.md#delete). Although data can't be altered, some certifications require that data is kept immutable, and can't be changed or deleted in storage. Data immutability can be achieved by using [data export](./logs/logs-data-export.md) to a storage account that's configured as [immutable storage](../storage/blobs/immutable-policy-configure-version-scope.md).
          
      - question: |
          What's a Log Analytics workspace?
        answer: |
          All log data collected by Azure Monitor is stored in a Log Analytics workspace. A workspace is essentially a container where log data is collected from various sources. You might have a single Log Analytics workspace for all your monitoring data, or you might have requirements for multiple workspaces. See [Design a Log Analytics workspace configuration](logs/workspace-design.md).
          
      - question: |
          Can you move an existing Log Analytics workspace to another Azure subscription?
        answer: |
          You can move a workspace between resource groups or subscriptions but not to a different region. See [Move a Log Analytics workspace to a different subscription or resource group](logs/move-workspace.md).
          
      - question: |
          Why can't I see Query Explorer and Save buttons in Log Analytics?
        answer: |
          **Query Explorer**, **Save**, and **New alert rule** buttons aren't available when the [query scope](logs/scope.md) is set to a specific resource. To create alerts or save or load a query, Log Analytics must be scoped to a workspace. To open Log Analytics in workspace context, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. The last used workspace is selected, but you can select any other workspace. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](logs/scope.md).
          
      - question: |
          Why am I getting the error "Register resource provider Microsoft.Insights for this subscription to enable this query" when I open Log Analytics from a VM?
        answer: |
          Many resource providers are automatically registered, but you might need to register some resource providers manually. The scope for registration is always the subscription. See [Resource providers and types](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#azure-portal).
          
      - question: |
          Why am I not getting an access error message when I open Log Analytics from a VM?
        answer: |
          To view VM logs, you need read permission for the workspace that stores the VM logs. In these cases, an administrator must grant your permission in Azure.

      - question: |
          Why can't I create an AzureDiagnostics table via template or modify schema via an API?
        answer: |
          `AzureDiagnostics` is a unique table that Log Analytics creates from data ingestion. Its schema can't be configured. A retention policy can be applied after the table is generated.
  
  - name: Metrics
    questions:
      - question: |
          Why are metrics from the guest OS of my Azure virtual machine not showing up in metrics explorer?
        answer: |
          [Platform metrics](essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md#monitoring-data) are collected automatically for Azure resources. You must perform some configuration, though, to collect metrics from the guest OS of a virtual machine. For a Windows VM, install the diagnostic extension and configure the Azure Monitor sink as described in [Install and configure Azure Diagnostics extension for Windows (WAD)](agents/diagnostics-extension-windows-install.md). For Linux, install the Telegraf agent as described in [Collect custom metrics for a Linux VM with the InfluxData Telegraf agent](essentials/collect-custom-metrics-linux-telegraf.md).

  - name: Prometheus
    questions:
      - question: |
          What's an Azure Monitor workspace? 
        answer: |
          Prometheus metrics collected by managed service for Prometheus are stored in an Azure Monitor workspace. It's essentially a container where Prometheus metrics from various sources are stored. You might have a single Azure Monitor workspace for all of your Prometheus metrics or you might have requirements for multiple workspaces. See [Azure Monitor workspace overview](essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md?#azure-monitor-workspace-architecture).  
      - question: |
          What's the difference between an Azure Monitor workspace and a Log Analytics workspace?
        answer: |
          An Azure Monitor workspace is a unique environment for data collected by Azure Monitor. Each workspace has its own data repository, configuration, and permissions. Azure Monitor workspaces will eventually contain all metrics collected by Azure Monitor, including native metrics. Currently, the only data hosted by an Azure Monitor workspace is Prometheus metrics. See [Azure Monitor workspace overview](essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md). 
      - question: |
          How do I retrieve Prometheus metrics? 
        answer: |
          All data is retrieved from an Azure Monitor workspace by using queries that are written in Prometheus Query Language (PromQL). You can write your own queries, use queries from the open source community, and use Grafana dashboards that include PromQL queries. See the [Prometheus project](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/). 
      - question: |
          Can I delete Prometheus metrics from an Azure Monitor workspace?
        answer: |
          Data is removed from the Azure Monitor workspace according to its data retention period, which is 18 months. 
      - question: |
          Can I view my Prometheus metrics in Azure Monitor metrics explorer? 
        answer: |
          Metrics explorer in Azure Monitor doesn't currently support visualizing Prometheus metric data. Consider using [Azure Managed Grafana](../managed-grafana/index.yml) to visualize your Prometheus metrics. 
      - question: |
          Can I use Azure Managed Grafana in a different region than my Azure Monitor workspace and managed service for Prometheus?
        answer: |
          Yes. When you use managed service for Prometheus, you can create your Azure Monitor workspace in any of the supported regions. Your Azure Kubernetes Service clusters can be in any region and send data into an Azure Monitor workspace in a different region. Azure Managed Grafana can also be in a different region than where you created your Azure Monitor workspace. 
      - question: |
          When I use managed service for Prometheus, can I store data for more than one cluster in an Azure Monitor workspace?
        answer: |
          Yes. Managed service for Prometheus is intended to enable scenarios where you can store data from several Azure Kubernetes Service clusters in a single Azure Monitor workspace. See [Azure Monitor workspace overview](essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md?#azure-monitor-workspace-architecture).  
      - question: |
          What types of resources can send Prometheus metrics to managed service for Prometheus?
        answer: |
          Our agent can be used on Azure Kubernetes Service clusters and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. It's installed as a managed add-on for AKS clusters and an extension for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and you can configure it to collect the data you want. You can also configure remote write on Kubernetes clusters running in Azure, another cloud, or on-premises by following our instructions for enabling remote write.

          If you use the Azure portal to enable Prometheus metrics collection and install the AKS add-on or Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes extension from the Insights page of your cluster, it enables logs collection into Log Analytics and Prometheus metrics collection into managed service for Prometheus.
      - question: |
          Does enabling managed service for Prometheus on my Azure Kubernetes Service cluster also enable Container insights?
        answer: |
          You have options for how you can collect your Prometheus metrics. If you use the Azure portal and enable Prometheus metrics collection and install the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) add-on from the Azure Monitor workspace UX, it won't enable Container insights and collection of log data. When you go to the Insights page on your AKS cluster, you're prompted to enable Container insights to collect log data.<br>
          
          If you use the Azure portal and enable Prometheus metrics collection and install the AKS add-on from the Insights page of your AKS cluster, it enables log collection into a Log Analytics workspace. and Prometheus metrics collection into an Azure Monitor workspace. 
      - question: |
          I am missing all or some of my metrics. How can I troubleshoot?
        answer: |
          You can use the troubleshooting guide for ingesting Prometheus metrics from the managed agent [here](essentials/prometheus-metrics-troubleshoot.md).
      - question: |
          Why am I missing metrics that have two labels with the same name but different casing?
        answer: |
          Metrics that have two label names that are the same except for their casing will be treated as having duplicate label names. These time series will be dropped upon ingestion since the two labels are seen as the same. For example, the time series `my_metric{ExampleLabel="label_value_0", examplelabel="label_value_1}` will be dropped due to duplicate labels since `ExampleLabel` and `examplelabel` will be seen as the same label name.
      - question: |
           I see some gaps in metric data, why is this occurring?   
        answer: |
           During node updates you might see a 1 to 2 minute gap in metric data for metrics collected from our cluster level collectors because the node that it runs on is being updated as part of a normal update process. This affects cluster-wide targets such as kube-state-metrics and custom application targets that are specified. This occurs when your cluster is updated manually or via auto-update. This is expected behavior that occurs due to the node it runs on being updated. None of our recommended alert rules are affected by this behavior. 
           
  - name: Change Analysis
    questions:
      - question: |
          Does using Change Analysis incur cost?
        answer: |
          You can use Change Analysis at no extra cost. Enable the `Microsoft.ChangeAnalysis` resource provider, and anything supported by Change Analysis is open to you.
      - question: |
          How can I enable Change Analysis for a web application?
        answer: |
          Enable Change Analysis for web application in guest changes by using the [Diagnose and solve problems tool](change/change-analysis-visualizations.md#diagnose-and-solve-problems-tool).

  - name: Alerts
    questions:
      - question: |
          What's an alert in Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          Alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues before the users of your system notice them. There are multiple kinds of alerts:
          
          - **Metric**: Metric value exceeds a threshold.
          - **Log query**: Results of a log query match defined criteria.
          - **Activity log**: Activity log event matches defined criteria.
          - **Web test**: Results of availability test match defined criteria.
          
          See [Overview of alerts in Azure](alerts/alerts-overview.md).
          
      - question: |
          What's an action group?
        answer: |
          An action group is a collection of notifications and actions that can be triggered by an alert. Multiple alerts can use a single action group allowing you to use common sets of notifications and actions. See [Create and manage action groups in the Azure portal](alerts/action-groups.md).
          
      - question: |
          What's an action rule?
        answer: |
          An action rule allows you to modify the behavior of a set of alerts that match a certain criteria. This rule allows you to perform such requirements as disabling alert actions during a maintenance window. You can also apply an action group to a set of alerts rather than applying them directly to the alert rules. See [Action rules](alerts/alerts-action-rules.md).
          
  - name: Agents
    questions:
      - question: |
          Does Azure Monitor require an agent?
        answer: |
          An agent is only required to collect data from the operating system and workloads in virtual machines. The virtual machines can be located in Azure, another cloud environment, or on-premises. See [Azure Monitor Agent overview](agents/agents-overview.md).
          
      - question: |
          What's the difference between the Azure Monitor agents?
        answer: |
          Azure Monitor Agent is the new, improved agent that consolidates features from all the other legacy monitoring agents. It also provides extra benefits like centralized data collection, filtering, and multihoming. See [Azure Monitor Agent overview](agents/agents-overview.md).  
          
          The legacy agents include:
          - Azure Diagnostics extension is for Azure Virtual Machines and collects data to Azure Monitor Metrics, Azure Storage, and Azure Event Hubs.  
          - The Log Analytics agent is for virtual machines in Azure, another cloud environment, or on-premises and collects data to Azure Monitor Logs. These agents will be deprecated by August 2024.
                  
      - question: |
          Does my agent traffic use my Azure ExpressRoute connection?
        answer: |
          Traffic to Azure Monitor uses the Microsoft peering ExpressRoute circuit. See [ExpressRoute documentation](../expressroute/expressroute-faqs.md#supported-services) for a description of the different types of ExpressRoute traffic.
          
      - question: |
          How can I confirm that the Log Analytics agent can communicate with Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          From Control Panel on the agent computer, select **Security & Settings** > **Microsoft Monitoring Agent**. Under the **Azure Log Analytics (OMS)** tab, a green check mark icon confirms that the agent can communicate with Azure Monitor. A yellow warning icon means the agent is having issues. One common reason is the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent** service has stopped. Use service control manager to restart the service.

      - question: |
          How do I stop the Log Analytics agent from communicating with Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          For agents connected to Log Analytics directly, open Control Panel and select **Microsoft Monitoring Agent**. Under the **Azure Log Analytics (OMS)** tab, remove all workspaces listed. In System Center Operations Manager, remove the computer from the Log Analytics managed computers list. Operations Manager updates the configuration of the agent to no longer report to Log Analytics.

      - question: |
          How much data is sent per agent?
        answer: |
          The amount of data sent per agent depends on:
          
          * The solutions you've enabled.
          * The number of logs and performance counters being collected.
          * The volume of data in the logs.
          
          See [Analyze usage in a Log Analytics workspace](logs/analyze-usage.md).
          
          For computers that are able to run the WireData agent, use the following query to see how much data is being sent:
          
          ```kusto
          WireData
          | where ProcessName == "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\\Agent\\MonitoringHost.exe"
          | where Direction == "Outbound"
          | summarize sum(TotalBytes) by Computer 
          ```
          
      - question: |
          How much network bandwidth is used by the Microsoft Monitoring Agent when it sends data to Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          Bandwidth is a function of the amount of data sent. Data is compressed as it's sent over the network.

      - question: |
          How can I be notified when data collection from the Log Analytics agent stops?
        answer: |
          Use the steps described in [Create a new log alert](alerts/alerts-metric.md) to be notified when data collection stops. Use the following settings for the alert rule:
          
          - **Define alert condition**: Specify your Log Analytics workspace as the resource target.
          - **Alert criteria**:

  - name: Azure Monitor Agent
    questions:
      - question: 
          Why should I use Azure Monitor Agent or migrate from the Log Analytics agent to Azure Monitor Agent?
        answer: |
          Azure Monitor Agent replaces the [Log Analytics agent](./agents/log-analytics-agent.md). It's also known as Microsoft Monitoring Agent. It replaces the [Azure Diagnostics extension](./agents/diagnostics-extension-overview.md) and the [Telegraf Agent](./essentials/collect-custom-metrics-linux-telegraf.md). Azure Monitor Agent offers a higher rate of EPS with a lower footprint. It provides enhanced filtering features, scalable deployment management, and configuration by using data collection rules and Azure policies.
          
          Azure Monitor Agent hasn't yet reached full parity with the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, but we continue to add features and support. The Microsoft Monitoring Agent will be retired on August 31, 2024.
          
          See [Azure Monitor Agent overview](./agents/azure-monitor-agent-overview.md).


      - question: |
          What's the upgrade path from Log Analytics agents to Azure Monitor Agent? How do we migrate?
        answer: |
          See [Migrating from the Log Analytics agent](./agents/azure-monitor-agent-migration.md).
          
          
      - question: |
          What's the upgrade path from the Log Analytics agent to Azure Monitor Agent for monitoring System Center Operations Manager? Can we use Azure Monitor Agent for System Center Operations Manager scenarios?
        answer: |
          Here's how Azure Monitor Agent affects the two System Center Operations Manager monitoring scenarios:
          - **Scenario 1**: Monitoring the Windows operating system of System Center Operations Manager. The upgrade path is the same as for any other machine. You can migrate from the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (versions 2016 and 2019) to Azure Monitor Agent as soon as your required parity features are available on Azure Monitor Agent.
          - **Scenario 2**: Onboarding or connecting System Center Operations Manager to Log Analytics workspaces. Use a System Center Operations Manager connector for Log Analytics/Azure Monitor. Neither the Microsoft Monitoring Agent nor Azure Monitor Agent is required to be installed on the Operations Manager management server. As a result, there's no impact to this use case from an Azure Monitor Agent perspective.  
                    
          
      - question: |
          Will Azure Monitor Agent support data collection for the various Log Analytics solutions and Azure services like Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel?
        answer: |
          Review the list of [Azure Monitor Agent extensions currently available in preview](./agents/azure-monitor-agent-overview.md#supported-services-and-features). These extensions are the same solutions and services now available by using the new Azure Monitor Agent instead. 
          You might see more extensions getting installed for the solution or service to collect extra data or perform transformation or processing as required for the solution or service. Then use Azure Monitor Agent to route the final data to Azure Monitor. 
          
          The following diagram explains the new extensibility architecture.
          
          ![Diagram that shows extensions architecture.](agents/media/azure-monitor-agent/extensibility-arch-new.png)
          
          
      - question: |
          Which Log Analytics solutions are supported on the new Azure Monitor Agent?
        answer: |
          See [Supported services and features](agents/azure-monitor-agent-overview.md#supported-services-and-features).
          
          
      - question: |
          How can I collect Windows security events by using the new Azure Monitor Agent?
        answer: |
          There are two ways you can collect Security events using the new agent, when sending to a Log Analytics workspace:
          - You can use AMA to natively collect Security Events, same as other Windows Events. These flow to the ['Event'](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/Event) table in your Log Analytics workspace. If you want Security Events to flow into the ['SecurityEvent'](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/SecurityEvent) table instead, you can [create the required DCR with PowerShell or with Azure Policy](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/how-to-configure-security-events-collection-with-azure-monitor/ba-p/3770719).
          - If you have Microsoft Sentinel enabled on the workspace, the security events flow via Azure Monitor Agent into the [`SecurityEvent`](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/SecurityEvent) table instead (the same as using the Log Analytics agent). This scenario always requires the solution to be enabled first.
          
      - question: |
          Can Azure Monitor Agent and the Log Analytics agent coexist side by side?
        answer: |
          Yes they can, but with certain considerations. Read more [about agent coexistence](agents/azure-monitor-agent-overview.md#coexistence-with-other-agents).
          
      - question: |
          Will I duplicate events if I use Azure Monitor Agent and the Log Analytics agent on the same machine? 
        answer: |
          If you're collecting the same events with both agents, duplication occurs. This duplication could be the legacy agent collecting redundant data from the [workspace configuration](agents/agent-data-sources.md) data, which is collected by the data collection rule. Or you might be collecting security events with the legacy agent and enable Windows security events with Azure Monitor Agent connectors in Microsoft Sentinel.
          
          Limit duplication events to only the time when you transition from one agent to the other. After you've fully tested the data collection rule and verified its data collection, disable collection for the workspace and disconnect any Microsoft Monitoring Agent data connectors.

      - question: |
          Is Azure Monitor Agent at parity with the Log Analytics agents?
        answer: |
          Review the [current limitations](agents/azure-monitor-agent-overview.md#current-limitations) of Azure Monitor Agent when compared with Log Analytics agents.
        
      - question: |
          Does Azure Monitor Agent support non-Azure environments like other clouds or on-premises?
        answer: |
          Both on-premises machines and machines connected to other clouds are supported for servers today, after you have the Azure Arc agent installed. For purposes of running Azure Monitor Agent and data collection rules, the Azure Arc requirement comes at *no extra cost or resource consumption*. The Azure Arc agent is only used as an installation mechanism. You don't need to enable the paid management features if you don't want to use them.
      
      - question: |
          Does Azure Monitor Agent support private links?
        answer: |
          Yes it does, via data collection endpoints created and added to an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope. [Walk through the setup steps](agents/azure-monitor-agent-data-collection-endpoint.md#enable-network-isolation-for-azure-monitor-agent).

      - question: |
          Does Azure Monitor Agent support auditd logs on Linux or AUOMS?
        answer: |
          Yes, but you need to [onboard to Defender for Cloud](agents/azure-monitor-agent-overview.md#supported-services-and-features) (previously Azure Security Center). It's available as an extension to Azure Monitor Agent, which collects Linux auditd logs via AUOMS.	
      
      - question: |
          Is Azure Arc required for Microsoft Entra joined machines?
        answer: |
          No. Microsoft Entra joined (or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined) machines running Windows 10 or 11 (client OS) **do not require Azure Arc** to be installed. Instead, you can use the Windows MSI installer for Azure Monitor Agent, which is [currently available in preview](https://aka.ms/amadcr-privatepreviews). 

      - question: |
          Why do I need to install the Azure Arc Connected Machine agent to use Azure Monitor Agent?
        answer: |
          Azure Monitor Agent authenticates to your workspace via managed identity, which is created when you install the Connected Machine agent. Managed Identity is a more secure and manageable authentication solution from Azure. The legacy Log Analytics agent authenticated by using the workspace ID and key instead, so it didn't need Azure Arc.

      - question: |
          What impact does installing the Azure Arc Connected Machine agent have on my non-Azure machine?
        answer: |
          There's no impact to the machine after the Azure Arc Connected Machine agent is installed. It hardly uses system or network resources and is designed to have a low footprint on the host where it's run.
          
      - question: |
          What types of machines does the new Azure Monitor Agent support?
        answer: |
          You can directly install them on virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and Azure Arc-enabled servers. You can also install them on devices like workstations and desktops running Windows 10 or 11 by using the Windows MSI installer for Azure Monitor Agent. It's [currently available in preview](https://aka.ms/amadcr-privatepreviews). 

      - question: |
          Can we filter events by using event ID? Is more granular event filtering possible by using the new Azure Monitor Agent?
        answer: |
          Yes. You can use Xpath queries for filtering Windows event logs. [Learn more](agents/data-collection-rule-azure-monitor-agent.md#filter-events-using-xpath-queries). 
          For performance counters, you can specify the counters you want to collect and exclude the ones you don't need.
          For Syslog on Linux, you can choose facilities and the log level for each facility to collect.
          
      - question: |
          Does the new Azure Monitor Agent support sending data to Azure Event Hubs and Azure Storage accounts?
        answer: |
          No, not yet. The new agent along with data collection rules will support sending data to both Event Hubs and Azure Storage accounts in the future when Azure Monitor Agent starts convergence with the diagnostics extensions.
          
      - question: |
          Does the new Azure Monitor Agent have hardening support for Linux?
        answer: |
          Hardening support for Linux isn't available yet.

      - question: |
          What roles do I need to create for a data collection rule that collects events from my servers?
        answer: |
          See [Permissions required to create data collection rules and associations](essentials/data-collection-rule-overview.md#permissions).

      - question: |
          If I create data collection rules that contain the same event ID and associate it to the same VM, will the events be duplicated?
        answer: |
          Yes. To avoid duplication, make sure the event selection you make in your data collection rules doesn't contain duplicate events.

      - question: |
          How can I validate my Xpath queries on Azure Monitor Agent?
        answer: |
          Use the [`Get-WinEvent`](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.diagnostics/get-winevent) PowerShell cmdlet **-FilterXPath** parameter to test the validity of an XPath query. For more information, see the tip provided in the [Windows agent-based connections](../sentinel/connect-services-windows-based.md) instructions.
          The [`Get-WinEvent`](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.diagnostics/get-winevent) PowerShell cmdlet supports up to 23 expressions. Azure Monitor data collection rules support up to 20. Also, `>` and `<` characters must be encoded as `&gt;` and `&lt;` in your data collection rule.

  - name: OpenTelemetry
    questions:
      - question: |
          What is OpenTelemetry?
        answer: |
          It's a new open-source standard for observability. Learn more at [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
          
      - question: |
          Why is Microsoft Azure Monitor investing in OpenTelemetry?
        answer: |
          Microsoft is among the largest contributors to OpenTelemetry.
          
          The key value propositions of OpenTelemetry are that it's vendor-neutral and provides consistent APIs/SDKs across languages.
          
          Over time, we believe OpenTelemetry will enable Azure Monitor customers to observe applications written in languages beyond our [supported languages](./app/app-insights-overview.md#supported-languages). It also expands the types of data you can collect through a rich set of [instrumentation libraries](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/components/#instrumentation-libraries). Furthermore, OpenTelemetry SDKs tend to be more performant at scale than their predecessors, the Application Insights SDKs.
          
          Finally, OpenTelemetry aligns with Microsoft's strategy to [embrace open source](https://opensource.microsoft.com/).
          
      - question: |
          What's the status of OpenTelemetry?
        answer: |
          See the [OpenTelemetry Spec Compliance Matrix](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/spec-compliance-matrix.md).
      
      - question: |
          What is the "Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro"?
        answer: |
          You can think of it as a thin wrapper that bundles together all the OpenTelemetry components for a first class experience on Azure.
      
      - question: |
          Why should I use the "Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro"?
        answer: |
          There are several advantages to using the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro over native OpenTelemetry from the community:
          - Reduces enablement effort
          - Supported by Microsoft
          - Brings in Azure Specific features such as:
              - Preserves traces with service components using Application Insights SDKs
              - [Microsoft Entra authentication](app/azure-ad-authentication.md)
              - [Offline Storage and Automatic Retries](app/opentelemetry-configuration.md#offline-storage-and-automatic-retries)
              - [Statsbeat](app/statsbeat.md)
              - [Application Insights Standard Metrics](app/standard-metrics.md)
              - Detect resource metadata to autopopulate [Cloud Role Name](app/app-map.md#understand-the-cloud-role-name-within-the-context-of-an-application-map) on Azure
              - [Live Metrics](app/live-stream.md) (future)
          
          In the spirit of OpenTelemetry, we've designed the distro to be open and extensible. For example, you can add:
           - An OTLP exporter and send to a second destination simultaneously
           - Community instrumentation libraries beyond what's bundled in with the package
          
      - question: |
          How can I test out the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro?
        answer: |
          Check out our enablement docs for [.NET, Java, JavaScript (Node.js), and Python](app/opentelemetry-enable.md).

      - question: |
          Should I use OpenTelemetry or the Application Insights SDK?
        answer: |
          It depends. Consider that the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro is still "Preview", and it's not quite at feature parity with the Application Insights SDKs.
      
      - question: |
          What's the current release state of features within the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro?
        answer: |
          The following chart breaks out OpenTelemetry feature support for each language.

          Yes, but we don't recommend it and Azure doesn't support it. OpenTelemetry JavaScript is heavily optimized for Node.js. Instead, we recommend using the Application Insights JavaScript SDK.

      - question: |
          When can we expect the OpenTelemetry SDK to be available for use in web browsers?
        answer: |
          The availability timeline for the OpenTelemetry web SDK hasn't been determined yet. We're likely several years away from a browser SDK that will be a viable alternative to the Application Insights JavaScript SDK.

      - question: |
          Can I test OpenTelemetry in a web browser today?
        answer: |
          The [OpenTelemetry web sandbox](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-sandbox-web-js) is a fork designed to make OpenTelemetry work in a browser. It's not yet possible to send telemetry to Application Insights. The SDK doesn't currently have defined general client events.

      - question: |
          Is running Application Insights alongside competitor agents like AppDynamics, DataDog, and NewRelic supported?
        answer: |
          No. This practice isn't something we plan to test or support, although our Distros allow you to [export to an OTLP endpoint](app/opentelemetry-configuration.md#enable-the-otlp-exporter) alongside Azure Monitor simultaneously.

      - question: |
          Can I use preview builds in production environments?
        answer: |
          We don't recommend it. See [Supplemental terms of use for Microsoft Azure previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
          
      - question: |
          Can I use the Azure Monitor Exporter as a standalone component?
        answer: |
          Yes, we understand some customers might want to instrument using a "piecemeal approach". However, the distro provides easiest way to get started with the best experience on Azure.

      - question: |
          What's the difference between manual and auto-instrumentation?
        answer: |
          See the [OpenTelemetry Overview](app/opentelemetry-overview.md#instrumentation-options).
          
      - question: |
          Can I use the OpenTelemetry Collector?
        answer: |
          Some customers have begun to use the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/design.md) as an agent alternative, even though Microsoft doesn't officially support an agent-based approach for application monitoring yet. In the meantime, the open-source community has contributed an [OpenTelemetry Collector Azure Monitor Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/azuremonitorexporter) that some customers are using to send data to Azure Monitor Application Insights.
          
          We plan to support an agent-based approach in the future, but the details and timeline aren't available yet. Our objective is to provide a path for any OpenTelemetry-supported language to send to Azure Monitor via the [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/README.md). This approach enables customers to observe applications written in languages beyond our [supported languages](./app/app-insights-overview.md#supported-languages). 
          
      - question: |
          What's the difference between OpenCensus and OpenTelemetry?
        answer: |
          [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) is the precursor to [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). Microsoft helped bring together [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) and OpenCensus to create OpenTelemetry, a single observability standard for the world. The current [production-recommended Python SDK](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/opencensus-python) for Azure Monitor is based on OpenCensus. Eventually, all Azure Monitor SDKs will be based on OpenTelemetry.

  - name: Container insights
  
    questions:
      - question: |
          Why do I see info banner "You do not have the right cluster permissions which will restrict your access to Container Insights features. Please reach out to your cluster admin to get the right permission"?
        answer: |
          Container Insights has historically allowed users to access the Azure portal experience based on the access permission of the Log Analytics workspace. It now checks cluster-level permission to provide access to the Azure portal experience. You might need your cluster admin to assign this permission.

          For basic read-only cluster level access, assign the **Monitoring Reader** role for the following types of clusters.

          - AKS without Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) authorization enabled
          - AKS enabled with Microsoft Entra SAML-based single sign-on
          - AKS enabled with Kubernetes RBAC authorization
          - AKS configured with the cluster role binding clusterMonitoringUser
          - [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview)

          See [Assign role permissions to a user or group](../aks/control-kubeconfig-access.md#assign-role-permissions-to-a-user-or-group) for details on how to assign these roles for AKS and [Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../aks/concepts-identity.md) to learn more about role assignments.
      - question: |
          What does "Other processes" represent under the Node view?
        answer: |
          *Other processes* are intended to help you clearly understand the root cause of the high resource usage on your node. This information helps you to distinguish usage between containerized processes versus noncontainerized processes.
          
          What are these other processes?
          
          They're noncontainerized processes that run on your node.
          
          How do we calculate this?
          
          **Other processes** = *Total usage from CAdvisor* - *Usage from containerized process*
          
          The other processes include:
          
          - Self-managed or managed Kubernetes noncontainerized processes.
          - Container run-time processes.
          - Kubelet.
          - System processes running on your node.
          - Other non-Kubernetes workloads running on node hardware or a VM.
          
      - question: |
          Why don't I see Image and Name property values populated when I query the ContainerLog table?
        answer: |
          For agent version ciprod12042019 and later, by default these two properties aren't populated for every log line to minimize cost incurred on log data collected. There are two options to query the table that include these properties with their values:
          
          ### Option 1
          
          Join other tables to include these property values in the results.
          
          Modify your queries to include `Image` and `ImageTag` properties from the `ContainerInventory` table by joining on `ContainerID` property. You can include the `Name` property (as it previously appeared in the `ContainerLog` table) from the `KubepodInventory` table's `ContainerName` field by joining on the `ContainerID` property. We recommend this option.
          
          The following example is a sample detailed query that explains how to get these field values with joins.
          
          ```
          //Let's say we're querying an hour's worth of logs
          let startTime = ago(1h);
          let endTime = now();
          //Below gets the latest Image & ImageTag for every containerID, during the time window
          let ContainerInv = ContainerInventory | where TimeGenerated >= startTime and TimeGenerated < endTime | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *)  by ContainerID, Image, ImageTag | project-away TimeGenerated | project ContainerID1=ContainerID, Image1=Image ,ImageTag1=ImageTag;
          //Below gets the latest Name for every containerID, during the time window
          let KubePodInv  = KubePodInventory | where ContainerID != "" | where TimeGenerated >= startTime | where TimeGenerated < endTime | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *)  by ContainerID2 = ContainerID, Name1=ContainerName | project ContainerID2 , Name1;
          //Now join the above 2 to get a 'jointed table' that has name, image & imagetag. Outer left is safer in case there are no kubepod records or if they're latent
          let ContainerData = ContainerInv | join kind=leftouter (KubePodInv) on $left.ContainerID1 == $right.ContainerID2;
          //Now join ContainerLog table with the 'jointed table' above and project-away redundant fields/columns and rename columns that were rewritten
          //Outer left is safer so you don't lose logs even if we can't find container metadata for loglines (due to latency, time skew between data types, etc.)
          ContainerLog
          | where TimeGenerated >= startTime and TimeGenerated < endTime
          | join kind= leftouter (
            ContainerData
          ) on $left.ContainerID == $right.ContainerID2 | project-away ContainerID1, ContainerID2, Name, Image, ImageTag | project-rename Name = Name1, Image=Image1, ImageTag=ImageTag1
          ```
          
          ### Option 2
          
          Reenable collection for these properties for every container log line.
          
          If the first option isn't convenient because of query changes involved, you can reenable collecting these fields. Enable the setting `log_collection_settings.enrich_container_logs` in the agent config map as described in the [data collection configuration settings](containers/container-insights-agent-config.md).
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > We don't recommend the second option for large clusters that have more than 50 nodes. It generates API server calls from every node in the cluster to perform this enrichment. This option also increases data size for every log line collected.
          
      - question: |
          Can I view metrics collected in Grafana?
        answer: |
          Container insights support viewing metrics stored in your Log Analytics workspace in Grafana dashboards. We've provided a template that you can download from the Grafana [dashboard repository](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards?dataSource=grafana-azure-monitor-datasource&category=docker). Use it to get started and as a reference to help you learn how to query data from your monitored clusters to visualize in custom Grafana dashboards.

      - question: |
          Why don't I see data in my Log Analytics workspace?
        answer: |
          If you're unable to see any data in the Log Analytics workspace at a certain time every day, you might have reached the default 500-MB limit or the cap specified to control the amount of data to collect daily. When the limit is met for the day, data collection stops and resumes only on the next day. To review your data usage and update to a different pricing tier based on your anticipated usage patterns, see [Azure Monitor Logs pricing information](logs/cost-logs.md).
          
      - question: |
          What are the container states specified in the ContainerInventory table?
        answer: |
          The `ContainerInventory` table contains information about both stopped and running containers. The table is populated by a workflow inside the agent that queries the docker for all the running and stopped containers. The agent forwards that data to the Log Analytics workspace.

      - question: |
          How do I resolve the "Missing Subscription registration" error?
        answer: |
          If you receive the error "Missing Subscription registration for Microsoft.OperationsManagement," you can resolve it by registering the resource provider **Microsoft.OperationsManagement** in the subscription where the workspace is defined. For the steps, see [Resolve errors for resource provider registration](../azure-resource-manager/templates/error-register-resource-provider.md).
          
      - question: |
          Is there support for Kubernetes RBAC-enabled Azure Kubernetes Service clusters?
        answer: |
          The Container Monitoring solution doesn't support Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC), but it's supported with Container insights. The solution details page might not show the right information in the panes that show data for these clusters.

      - question: |
          How do I enable log collection for containers in the kube-system namespace through Helm?
        answer: |
          The log collection from containers in the kube-system namespace is disabled by default. You can enable log collection by setting an environment variable on Azure Monitor Agent. See the [Container insights](https://aka.ms/azuremonitor-containers-helm-chart) GitHub page.
          
      - question: |
          How do I update Azure Monitor Agent in Container insights to the latest released version?
        answer: |
          To learn how to upgrade the agent, see [Agent management](containers/container-insights-manage-agent.md).
          
      - question: |
          Why are log lines larger than 16 KB split into multiple records in Log Analytics?
        answer: |
          The agent uses the [Docker JSON file logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/) to capture the stdout and stderr of containers. This logging driver splits log lines [larger than 16 KB](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/22982) into multiple lines when they're copied from stdout or stderr to a file.
          
      - question: |
          How do I enable multi-line logging?
        answer: |
          Container insights now supports multi-line logging (preview), for more information on how to enable, checkout the [Multi-line logging in Container Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-logging-v2) docs. 
          
          As an alternative you can also configure all the services to write in JSON format, and then Docker/Moby writes them as a single line. For example, you can wrap your log as a JSON object as shown in the following example for a sample Node.js application
          
          ```
          console.log(json.stringify({ 
                "Hello": "This example has multiple lines:",
                "Docker/Moby": "will not break this into multiple lines",
                "and you'll receive":"all of them in log analytics",
                "as one": "log entry"
                }));
          ```
          
          This data will look like the following example in Azure Monitor for logs when you query for it:
          
          ```
          LogEntry : ({"Hello": "This example has multiple lines:","Docker/Moby": "will not break this into multiple lines", "and you'll receive":"all of them in log analytics", "as one": "log entry"}
          ```
          
          For a detailed look at the issue, see this [GitHub page](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/22920).
          
      - question: |
          How do I resolve Microsoft Entra errors when I enable live logs?
        answer: |
          You might see the following error: "The reply url specified in the request doesn't match the reply urls configured for the application: '<application ID\>'." For the solution, see [View container data in real time with Container insights](containers/container-insights-livedata-setup.md#configure-azure-ad-integrated-authentication).
          
      - question: |
          Why can't I upgrade a cluster after onboarding?
        answer: |
          Here's the scenario: You enabled Container insights for an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. Then you deleted the Log Analytics workspace where the cluster was sending its data. Now when you attempt to upgrade the cluster, it fails. To work around this issue, you must disable monitoring and then reenable it by referencing a different valid workspace in your subscription. When you try to perform the cluster upgrade again, it should process and complete successfully.

      - question: |
          Which ports and domains do I need to open or allow for the agent?
        answer: |
          See the [Network firewall requirements](containers/container-insights-onboard.md#network-firewall-requirements) for the proxy and firewall configuration information that's required for the containerized agent with Azure, Azure US Government, and Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet clouds.
          
      - question: |
          Is there support for collecting Kubernetes audit logs for ARO clusters?
        answer:
          No. Container insights don't support collection of Kubernetes audit logs.

      - question: |
          Why don't I see Normal event types when I query the KubeEvents table?
        answer:
          By default, Normal event types aren't collected unless the *collect_all_kube_events* ConfigMap setting is enabled. If you need to collect Normal events, enable *collect_all_kube_events setting* in the *container-azm-ms-agentconfig* ConfigMap. See [Configure agent data collection for Container insights](containers/container-insights-agent-config.md) for information on how to configure the ConfigMap.

      - question: |
          Does Container Insights support pod sandboxing?
        answer: |
          Yes, Container Insights supports pod sandboxing through support for Kata Containers. For more details on pod sandboxing in AKS, [refer to the AKS docs](/azure/aks/use-pod-sandboxing).
          

      
  - name: VM insights
    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I onboard to an existing workspace?
        answer: |
          If your VMs are already connected to a Log Analytics workspace, you might continue to use that workspace when you onboard to VM insights, provided it's in one of the [supported regions](vm/vminsights-configure-workspace.md#supported-regions).
          
      - question: |
          Can I onboard to a new workspace?
        answer: |
          If your VMs aren't currently connected to an existing Log Analytics workspace, you need to create a new workspace to store your data. Creating a new default workspace is done automatically if you configure a single Azure VM for VM insights through the Azure portal.
          
          If you choose to use the script-based method, these steps are described in [Enable VM insights by using Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager templates](./vm/vminsights-enable-powershell.md).
          
      - question: |
          What do I do if my VM is already reporting to an existing workspace?
        answer: |
          If you're already collecting data from your VM, you might have already configured it to report data to an existing Log Analytics workspace. If that workspace is in one of our supported regions, you can enable VM insights to that preexisting workspace. If the workspace you're already using isn't in one of our supported regions, you can't onboard to VM insights at this time. We're working to support more regions.

      - question: |
          Why did my VM fail to onboard?
        answer: |
          The following steps occur when you onboard an Azure VM from the Azure portal:
          
          * A default Log Analytics workspace is created, if that option was selected.
          * The Log Analytics agent is installed on Azure VMs by using a VM extension, if it's required.
          * The VM insights Map Dependency agent is installed on Azure VMs by using an extension, if it's required.
          
          During the onboarding process, we check for status on each of the preceding to return a notification status to you in the portal. Configuration of the workspace and the agent installation typically takes 5 to 10 minutes. Viewing monitoring data in the portal takes an extra 5 to 10 minutes.
          
          If you've initiated onboarding and see messages indicating the VM needs to be onboarded, allow for up to 30 minutes for the VM to complete the process.
          
      - question: |
          Why don't I see some or any data in the performance charts for my VM?
        answer: |
          If you don't see performance data in the disk table or in some of the performance charts, your performance counters might not be configured in the workspace. To resolve this issue, run this [PowerShell script](./vm/vminsights-enable-powershell.md).
          
      - question: |
          How is the VM insights Map feature different from Service Map?
        answer: |
          The VM insights Map feature is based on Service Map, but it has the following differences:
          
          * The Map view can be accessed from the VM pane and from VM insights under Azure Monitor.
          * The connections in the map are now clickable and display a view of the connection metric data in the side pane for the selected connection.
          * A new API creates the maps to better support more complex maps.
          * Monitored VMs are now included in the client group node. The donut chart shows the proportion of monitored versus unmonitored VMs in the group. It can also be used to filter the list of machines when the group is expanded.
          * Monitored VMs are now included in the server port group nodes. The donut chart shows the proportion of monitored versus unmonitored machines in the group. It can also be used to filter the list of machines when the group is expanded.
          * The map style was updated to be more consistent with App Map from Application insights.
          * The side panes have been updated and don't have the full set of integrations that were supported in Service Map: Update Management, Change Tracking, Security, and Service Desk.
          * The option for choosing groups and machines to map was updated and now supports subscriptions, resource groups, Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and cloud services.
          * You can't create new Service Map machine groups in the VM insights Map feature.
          
      - question: |
          Why do my performance charts show dotted lines?
        answer: |
          Dotted lines can occur for a few reasons. In cases where there's a gap in data collection, the lines appear as dotted. 
          
          The default setting for data sampling frequency is to collect data every 60 seconds. If you modified the frequency for the performance counters enabled, dotted lines are used in the chart if you chose a narrow time range for the chart and your sampling frequency is less than the bucket size used in the chart. 
          
          For example, the sampling frequency is every 10 minutes, and each bucket on the chart is 5 minutes. Choosing a wider time range to view should cause the chart lines to appear as solid lines rather than dotted lines in this case.

      - question: |
          Are groups supported with VM insights?
        answer: |
          Yes. After you install the Dependency agent, we collect information from the VMs to display groups based on subscription, resource group, virtual machine scale sets, and cloud services. 
          
          If you've been using Service Map and have created machine groups, these groups are displayed too. Computer groups also appear in the groups filter if you created them for the workspace you're viewing.

      - question: |
          How do I see the information for what's driving the 95th percentile line in the aggregate performance charts?
        answer: |
          By default, the list is sorted to show you the VMs that have the highest value for the 95th percentile for the selected metric. The Available memory chart is an exception. It shows the machines with the lowest value of the 5th percentile. Selecting the chart opens the **Top N List** view with the appropriate metric selected.

      - question: |
          How does the Map feature handle duplicate IPs across different virtual networks and subnets?
        answer: |
          If you're duplicating IP ranges either with VMs or Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets across subnets and virtual networks, VM insights Map might display incorrect information. This issue is known. We're investigating options to improve this experience.

      - question: |
          Does the Map feature support IPv6?
        answer: |
          The Map feature currently only supports IPv4. We're investigating support for IPv6. We also support IPv4 that's tunneled inside IPv6.

      - question: |
          When I load a map for a resource group or other large group, why is the map difficult to view?
        answer: |
          Although we've made improvements to Map to handle large and complex configurations, we realize a map can have many nodes, connections, and nodes working as a cluster. We're committed to continuing to enhance support to increase scalability.

      - question: |
          Why does the network chart on the Performance tab look different than the network chart on the Azure VM overview page?
        answer: |
          The overview page for an Azure VM displays charts based on the host's measurement of activity in the guest VM. The network chart on the Azure VM overview only displays network traffic that will be billed. Inter-virtual network traffic isn't included. The data and charts shown for VM insights are based on data from the guest VM. The network chart displays all TCP/IP traffic that's inbound and outbound to that VM, including inter-virtual network traffic.

      - question: |
          How is response time measured for data stored in VMConnection and displayed in the connection panel and workbooks?
        answer: |
          Response time is an approximation. Because we don't instrument the code of the application, we don't know when a request begins and when the response arrives. Instead, we observe data being sent on a connection and coming back on that connection. 
          
          Our agent keeps track of the sends and receives and attempts to pair them. A sequence of sends, followed by a sequence of receives, is interpreted as a request/response pair. The timing between these operations is the response time. It includes the network latency and the server processing time.
          
          This approximation works well for protocols that are request/response based. A single request goes out on the connection, and a single response arrives. This behavior is the case for HTTP(S) (without pipelining), but it's not satisfied for other protocols.
          
      - question: |
          Are there limitations if I'm on the Log Analytics Free pricing plan?
        answer: |
          If you've configured Azure Monitor with a Log Analytics workspace by using the **Free** pricing tier, the VM insights Map feature supports only five connected machines that are connected to the workspace. If you have five VMs connected to a free workspace and you disconnect one of the VMs and later connect a new VM, the new VM isn't monitored and reflected on the Map page.
          
          Under this condition, you're prompted with the **Try Now** option when you open the VM and select **Insights** from the pane on the left, even after it has already been installed on the VM. However, you're not prompted with options as would normally occur if this VM weren't onboarded to VM insights.

          What operating systems for the monitoring virtual machine are supported?
        answer: |
          Ubuntu 18.04 is currently the only operating system supported for the monitoring virtual machine.

      - question: |
          Where is the monitoring data stored in Log Analytics?
        answer: |
          All the monitoring data is stored in the `InsightsMetrics` table. The `Origin` column has the value `solutions.azm.ms/telegraf/SqlInsights`. The `Namespace` column has values that start with `sqlserver_`.

      - question: |
          How often is data collected?
        answer: |
          The frequency of data collection is customizable. See [Data collected by SQL Insights (preview)](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-insights-overview#collected-data) for information on the default frequencies. See [Create SQL monitoring profile](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-insights-enable#create-sql-monitoring-profile) for instructions on customizing frequencies.
