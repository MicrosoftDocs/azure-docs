# What is monitored by Azure Monitor?

This article is a reference of the different applications and services that are monitored by Azure Monitor.

## Insights and curated visualizations

Some services have a curated monitoring experience. That is, Microsoft provides customized functionality meant to act as a starting point for monitoring those services. These experiences are collectively known as **curated visualizations** with the larger more complex of them being called **Insights**.  

The experiences collect and analyze a subset of logs and metrics and depending on the service and might also provide out-of-the-box alerting. They present this telemetry in a visual layout. The visualizations vary in size and scale. Some are considered part of Azure Monitor and follow the support and service level agreements for Azure. They are supported in all Azure regions where Azure Monitor is available. Other curated visualizations provide less functionality, might not scale, and might have different agreements.  Some might be based solely on Azure Monitor Workbooks, while others might have an extensive custom experience. 

The table below lists the available curated visualizations and more detailed information about them.  

>[!NOTE]
> Another type of older visualization called **monitoring solutions** are no longer in active development.  The replacement technology is the Azure Monitor Insights mentioned above. We suggest you use the insights and not deploy new instances of solutions. For more information on the solutions, see [Monitoring solutions in Azure Monitor](./insights/solutions.md).
