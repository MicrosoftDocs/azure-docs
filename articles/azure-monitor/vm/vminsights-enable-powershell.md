# Enable VM insights by using PowerShell
This article describes how to enable VM insights on Azure virtual machines by using PowerShell. This procedure can be used for:

- Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets

> [!NOTE]
> This article only applies to the Log Analytics agent. To enable VM insights with the Azure Monitor agent, use other installation methods described in [Enable VM insights overview](vminsights-enable-overview.md).
## Prerequisites

You need to:

- [Configure a Log Analytics workspace for VM insights](../vm/vminsights-configure-workspace.md).
- See [Supported operating systems](./vminsights-enable-overview.md#supported-operating-systems) to ensure that the operating system of the virtual machine or virtual machine scale set you're enabling is supported.
- See [Manage Azure Monitor Agent](../agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage.md#prerequisites) for prerequisites related to Azure Monitor Agent.

## PowerShell script

To enable VM insights for multiple VMs or virtual machine scale set, use the PowerShell script [Install-VMInsights.ps1](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Install-VMInsights). The script is available from the Azure PowerShell Gallery. This script iterates through:

- Every virtual machine and virtual machine scale set in your subscription.
- The scoped resource group that's specified by *ResourceGroup*.
- A single VM or virtual machine scale set that's specified by *Name*.

For each virtual machine or virtual machine scale set, the script verifies whether the VM extension for the Log Analytics agent and Dependency agent is already installed. If both extensions are installed, the script tries to reinstall it. If both extensions aren't installed, the script installs them.

Verify that you're using Azure PowerShell module Az version 1.0.0 or later with `Enable-AzureRM` compatibility aliases enabled. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell). If you're running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

To get a list of the script's argument details and example usage, run `Get-Help`.

```powershell
Get-Help .\Install-VMInsights.ps1 -Detailed

SYNOPSIS
    This script installs VM extensions for Log Analytics and the Dependency agent as needed for VM Insights.


SYNTAX
    .\Install-VMInsights.ps1 [-WorkspaceId] <String> [-WorkspaceKey] <String> [-SubscriptionId] <String> [[-ResourceGroup]
    <String>] [[-Name] <String>] [[-PolicyAssignmentName] <String>] [-ReInstall] [-TriggerVmssManualVMUpdate] [-Approve] [-WorkspaceRegion] <String>
    [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]


DESCRIPTION
    This script installs or reconfigures the following on VMs and virtual machine scale sets:
    - Log Analytics VM extension configured to supplied Log Analytics workspace
    - Dependency agent VM extension

    Can be applied to:
    - Subscription
    - Resource group in a subscription
    - Specific VM or virtual machine scale set
    - Compliance results of a policy for a VM or VM extension

    Script will show you a list of VMs or virtual machine scale sets that will apply to and let you confirm to continue.
    Use -Approve switch to run without prompting, if all required parameters are provided.

    If the extensions are already installed, they will not install again.
    Use -ReInstall switch if you need to, for example, update the workspace.

    Use -WhatIf if you want to see what would happen in terms of installs, what workspace configured to, and status of the extension.


PARAMETERS
    -WorkspaceId <String>
        Log Analytics WorkspaceID (GUID) for the data to be sent to

    -WorkspaceKey <String>
        Log Analytics Workspace primary or secondary key

    -SubscriptionId <String>
        SubscriptionId for the VMs/VM Scale Sets
        If using PolicyAssignmentName parameter, subscription that VMs are in

    -ResourceGroup <String>
        <Optional> Resource Group to which the VMs or VM Scale Sets belong

    -Name <String>
        <Optional> To install to a single VM/VM Scale Set

    -PolicyAssignmentName <String>
        <Optional> Take the input VMs to operate on as the Compliance results from this Assignment
        If specified will only take from this source.

    -ReInstall [<SwitchParameter>]
        <Optional> If VM/VM Scale Set is already configured for a different workspace, set this to change to the new workspace

    -TriggerVmssManualVMUpdate [<SwitchParameter>]
        <Optional> Set this flag to trigger update of VM instances in a scale set whose upgrade policy is set to Manual

    -Approve [<SwitchParameter>]
        <Optional> Gives the approval for the installation to start with no confirmation prompt for the listed VMs/VM Scale Sets

    -WorkspaceRegion <String>
        Region the Log Analytics Workspace is in
        Supported values: "East US","eastus","Southeast Asia","southeastasia","West Central US","westcentralus","West Europe","westeurope"
        For Health supported is: "East US","eastus","West Central US","westcentralus"

    -WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]
        <Optional> See what would happen in terms of installs.
        If extension is already installed will show what workspace is currently configured, and status of the VM extension

    -Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]
        <Optional> Confirm every action

    <CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see
        about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------
    .\Install-VMInsights.ps1 -WorkspaceRegion eastus -WorkspaceId <WorkspaceId> -WorkspaceKey <WorkspaceKey> -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId>
    -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroup>

    Install for all VMs in a resource group in a subscription

    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------
    .\Install-VMInsights.ps1 -WorkspaceRegion eastus -WorkspaceId <WorkspaceId> -WorkspaceKey <WorkspaceKey> -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId>
    -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroup> -ReInstall

    Specify to reinstall extensions even if already installed, for example, to update to a different workspace

    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------
    .\Install-VMInsights.ps1 -WorkspaceRegion eastus -WorkspaceId <WorkspaceId> -WorkspaceKey <WorkspaceKey> -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId>
    -PolicyAssignmentName a4f79f8ce891455198c08736 -ReInstall

    Specify to use a PolicyAssignmentName for source and to reinstall (move to a new workspace)
```

The following example demonstrates using the PowerShell commands in the folder to enable VM insights and understand the expected output:

```powershell
$WorkspaceId = "<GUID>"
$WorkspaceKey = "<Key>"
$SubscriptionId = "<GUID>"
.\Install-VMInsights.ps1 -WorkspaceId $WorkspaceId -WorkspaceKey $WorkspaceKey -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId -WorkspaceRegion eastus

Getting list of VMs or virtual machine scale sets matching criteria specified

VMs or virtual machine scale sets matching criteria:

db-ws-1 VM running
db-ws2012 VM running

This operation will install the Log Analytics and Dependency agent extensions on the previous two VMs or virtual machine scale sets.
VMs in a non-running state will be skipped.
Extension will not be reinstalled if already installed. Use -ReInstall if desired, for example, to update workspace.
