## Datadog

![Datadog logo.](./media/partners/datadog.png)

Azure enables customers to migrate and modernize their applications to run in the cloud, in coordination with many partner solutions. One such partner is Datadog, which provides observability and security tools for users to understand the health and performance of their applications across hybrid and multiple-cloud environments. But configuring the necessary integrations often requires moving between the Azure portal and Datadog. This process adds complexity, takes time, and makes it difficult to troubleshoot if things aren't working.  

To reduce the burden of managing across multiple portals, Microsoft has worked with Datadog to create an integrated Datadog solution on the Azure cloud platform. Available via Azure Marketplace, this solution provides a seamless experience for using the Datadog cloud monitoring solution in Azure.  

With the integration between Azure and Datadog, organizations can now fully map their legacy and cloud-based systems, monitor real-time data during every phase of the cloud transition, and help ensure that migrated applications meet performance targets. This integration combines the global presence, flexibility, security, and compliance capabilities of Azure with the logging and monitoring capabilities of Datadog. 

Through this unified experience, you'll be able to: 

- Provision a new Datadog organization and configure Azure resources to send logs and metrics to Datadog. This is a fully managed setup with no infrastructure for customers to set up and operate.  
- Seamlessly send logs and metrics to Datadog. The log-forwarding process has been completely automated. Rather than build out a log-forwarding pipeline with diagnostic settings, event hubs, and functions, you can configure everything with just a few clicks.
-	Easily install the Datadog agent on VM hosts through a single click.
-	Streamline single-sign on (SSO) to Datadog. A separate sign-on from the Datadog portal is no longer required. 
-	Get unified billing for the Datadog service through Azure subscription invoicing.

The [Datadog integration with Azure](../partner-solutions/datadog/overview.md) is available in [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/datadog1591740804488.dd_liftr_v2?tab=Overview). 

For documentation on the integration, see [Datadog integration with Azure](../partner-solutions/datadog/index.yml). If you're still using the previous, manually configured integration, see the [documentation on the Datadog website](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/azure/).

## Dynatrace

![Dynatrace logo.](./media/partners/dynatrace.png)

- Single sign-on: You can easily enable SSO through Azure Active Directory. 
- Metrics and logs: You can enable the collection of metrics and logs for Virtual Machine (VM) and App Services resources by installing Dynatrace OneAgent on those resources. Furthermore, you can activate the sending of Azure [subscription activity logs](./essentials/activity-log-schema.md) and [resource logs](./essentials/resource-logs-categories.md) to Dynatrace.
- OneAgent deployment: You can install or uninstall Dynatrace OneAgents on single or multiple virtual machines and Azure App Services directly from your Azure Portal.
- Manage Dynatrace within Azure portal: Within your Azure Portal, you can verify which resources are sending Azure metrics and logs to Dynatrace and make instant changes as needed.
- Deeper Azure CLI integration: You can easily manage Dynatrace resources from the Azure CLI to further extend deployments of those resources with ARM templates or other third-party IAAC platforms, such as Terraform.
- Azure Monitor metrics collection: The collection of Azure Monitor metrics from your Azure subscription can be activated with one click with no need for configuration or hosting of infrastructure/components. This includes Azure services such as App Services & Functions, Azure Databases, Azure Load Balancers, Azure Storage, and many more (see the complete list of services). Monitoring with the Azure Native Dynatrace Service is set up in the background and activated from the Azure console in a second.
