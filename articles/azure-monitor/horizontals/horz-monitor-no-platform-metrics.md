## Azure Monitor platform metrics

Azure Monitor provides platform metrics for many services. For a list of all metrics it's possible to gather for all resources in Azure Monitor, see [Supported metrics in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

This service doesn't gather platform metrics.
