## Azure Monitor resource logs

Resource logs provide insight into operations that were done by an Azure resource. Logs are generated automatically, but you must route them to Azure Monitor Logs to save or query them. Logs are organized into categories. A given namespace can have multiple resource log categories you can collect.

This service doesn't collect resource logs,  but you can find information about them in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-Azure-resources).
