# How to view Kubernetes logs, events, and pod metrics in real time

Azure Monitor for containers includes the Live Console (preview) feature, which is an advanced diagnostic feature allowing you direct access to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) container logs (stdout/stderror), events, and pod metrics. It exposes direct access to `kubectl logs -c`, `kubectl get` events, and `kubectl top pods`. It shows live logging and events generated by the container engine to further assist in troubleshooting issues in real time.

This article provides a detailed overview and helps you understand how to use this feature. 

>[!NOTE]
>AKS clusters enabled as [private clusters](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/aks-private-cluster/) are not supported with this feature. This feature relies on directly accessing the Kubernetes API through a proxy server from your browser. Enabling networking security to block the Kubernetes API from this proxy will block this traffic. 

>[!NOTE]
>This feature is available in all Azure regions, including Azure China. It is currently not available in Azure US Government.

For help setting up or troubleshooting the Live Metrics and Data (preview) feature, review our [setup guide](container-insights-livelogs-setup.md). This feature directly access the Kubernetes API, and additional information about the authentication model can be found [here](container-insights-livelogs-setup.md#authentication-model). 

## Live Console functionality overview

### Search

![Live logs pane filter example](./media/container-insights-live-logs/live-logs-pane-filter-example-01.png)

The Live Events and Logs (preview) feature includes search functionality. In the **Search** field, you can filter results by typing a key word or term and any matching results are highlighted to allow quick review. While viewing events, you can additionally limit the results using the **Filter** pill found to the right of the search bar. Depending on what resource you have selected, the pill lists a pod, namespace, or cluster to chose from.  

### Scroll Lock and Pause 

To suspend autoscroll and control the behavior of the pane, allowing you to manually scroll through the new data read, you can use the **Scroll** option. To re-enable autoscroll, simply select the **Scroll** option again. You can also pause retrieval of log or event data by selecting the the **Pause** option, and when you are ready to resume, simply select **Play**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>We recommend only suspending or pausing autoscroll for a short period of time while troubleshooting an issue. These requests may impact the availability and throttling of the Kubernetes API on your cluster. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
No data is stored permanently during operation of this feature. All information captured during the session is deleted when you close your browser or navigate away from it. Data only remains present for visualization inside the five minute window of the metrics feature; any metrics older than five minutes are also deleted. The Live Logs and Events buffer queries within reasonable memory usage limits (need to be more specific here, what is reasonable?). 

## Live Logs

You can view real-time log data as they are generated by the container engine from the **Nodes**, **Controllers**, and **Containers** view. To view live log data, perform the following steps.

1. In the Azure portal, browse to the AKS cluster resource group and select your AKS resource.

2. On the AKS cluster dashboard, under **Monitoring** on the left-hand side, choose **Insights**. 

3. Select either the **Nodes**, **Controllers**, or **Containers** tab.

4. Select a container from the performance grid and on the properties pane found on the right side, select **View live data (preview)** option. A pane is presented below the performance data table where you can view log data in a continuous stream.

    The pane title shows the name of the pod the container is grouped with.

    If the AKS cluster is configured with SSO using AAD, you are prompted to authenticate on first use during that browser session. Select your account and complete authentication with Azure.  

    >[!NOTE]
    >When viewing the data from your Log Analytics workspace by selecting the **View in analytics** option from the properties pane, the log search results will potentially show **Nodes**, **Daemon Sets**, **Replica Sets**, **Jobs**, **Cron Jobs**, **Pods**, and **Containers** which may no longer exist. Attempting to search logs for a container which isn’t available in `kubectl` will also fail here. Review the [View in analytics](container-insights-log-search.md#search-logs-to-analyze-data) feature to learn more about viewing historical logs, events and metrics.  

After successfully authenticating, the live log pane will appear in the bottom section of the middle pane. If the fetch status indicator shows a green check mark, which is on the far right of the pane. It means data can be retrieved and it will begin streaming to your console.

## Live Events

You can view real-time event data as they are generated by the container engine from the **Nodes**, **Controllers**, **Containers**, and **Deployments (preview)** view when a Container, Pod, Node, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob or Deployment is selected. To view live events, perform the following steps.
