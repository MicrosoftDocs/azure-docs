    questions: 
      - question:  What capabilities do you gain with Azure Center for SAP solutions?
        answer: | 
                Before the availability of ACSS, customers relied on documentation and frameworks to help them set up system architecture. 
                Then they had to figure out how to access the VMs to install SAP. With ACSS, customers can deploy SAP by using a 
                guided experience that streamlines their ability to select and configure resources. When a customer deploys or 
                registers an existing SAP system, ACSS creates a logical representation of the system, or a Virtual Instance for SAP solutions (VIS). 
                The VIS unlocks management capabilities, such as the ability to run quality checks and to manage and monitor the 
                system at the SAP layer as well as the virtual machine (VM) layer.

      - question:  Will ACSS replace other services such as Azure Monitor for SAP solutions?
        answer: | 
                No. ACSS brings Azure services together into a unified experience for deploying 
                and managing SAP workloads on Azure. Customers can choose to use other Azure services, such as Azure 
                Monitor for SAP solutions (AMS), independently or in an integrated manner with ACSS.
                AMS is an Azure-native monitoring product for customers running SAP 
                landscapes on Azure. This product helps you collect data from Azure infrastructure and databases in one 
                central location and visually correlate the data for faster troubleshooting.

      - question:  What are the pricing and licensing implications?
        answer: | 
                There's no extra licensing cost for deploying or registering an SAP system and generating a virtual 
                instance. You pay only for 
                the compute, storage, networking and other Azure resources you deploy or enable. 

      - question:  Which scenarios does ACSS support?
        answer: | 
                ACSS supports the following capabilities at this time.

                - Deployment of infrastructure for SAP S4/HANA systems
                - Software installation of SAP S4/HANA 1909 SPS 03, S/4HANA 2020 SPS 03, S/4HANA 2021 ISS 00
                - Registration of an existing Windows and Linux based ABAP/NetWeaver SAP system on Azure
                - Monitoring the health and status of an SAP system
                - Creating a new AMS provider or integrating an existing one
                - Starting and stopping an SAP System
                - Quality checks and recommendations for an SAP system with Azure Advisor
                - Analyze the cost of running the SAP System in Azure [non-shared resources only]

                ACSS doesn't allow customization of the names of the Azure 
                resources deployed through it. ACSS follows a prescriptive naming convention for all Azure resources deployed.
                Consider the open-source [SAP deployment automation framework](../virtual-machines/workloads/sap/automation-deployment-framework.md) 
                if you need the ability to customize names for your deployments. Then register your open-source deployments in ACSS to unlock intelligent management capabilities.

      - question:  What is a VIS resource?
        answer: | 
                The Virtual Instance for SAP solutions (VIS) resource is an essential component of ACSS that 
                forms the foundation for the new experience. The VIS is a logical representation of your SAP system in Azure
                that provides SAP awareness in Azure and unlocks new management capabilities. When you deploy a new 
                SAP system or register an existing SAP system, ACSS automatically creates a 
                VIS for you.

      - question:  What existing SAP systems can be registered as a VIS?
        answer: | 
                You can register any of the following existing systems on Azure to create a VIS in Azure Center 
                for SAP solutions:

                - SAP systems running on SAP NetWeaver or ABAP stack
                - SAP systems running on Windows, SUSE and RHEL Linux Operating Systems
                - SAP systems running on HANA, DB2, SQL Server, Oracle, Max DB, SAP ASE databases

      - question:  What are the prerequisites to deploy a new SAP system with ACSS?
        answer: |
                Here are prerequisites to deploy a new SAP system with ACSS and create a VIS. For more information, see the [deployment guide](deploy-s4hana.md).

                - Make sure you and the ACSS service have contributor roles at the 
                subscription or resource group(s) level.
                - Identify an existing virtual network with outbound internet connectivity where you'll deploy 
                your new SAP system.
                - Register appropriate resource providers.
                - Make sure there are sufficient virtual machine quotas for the region(s) that you're using for deployment.

      - question:  What are the prerequisites to register an existing SAP system in ACSS?
        answer: | 
                ACSS requires contributor role access on the resource groups that include the 
                SAP system(s) that you're trying to register. Alternatively, you can grant contributor access on the 
                subscription that includes the SAP systems.

      - question:  What regions support the VIS as part of ACSS?
        answer: | 
                The VIS resource is available in the following Azure regions: West Europe, North Europe, East US, East 
                US 2, West US 2, West US 3, Central US, South Central US, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia East and 
                Australia Central.

      - question:  What is the SLA for this service?
        answer: | 
                Previews are excluded from service-level agreements.
