# Tutorial: Install Azure FXT Edge Filer

> [!NOTE]
> **Action Required:** Azure FXT Edge Filer will be retired on December 31, 2026. Please remove all Azure FXT Edge Filer resources by December 31, 2026. Visit https://aka.ms/fxtretirementfaq for more information.

This tutorial describes how to install a hardware node for the Azure FXT Edge Filer hybrid storage cache. You need to install at least three hardware nodes to create an Azure FXT Edge Filer cluster.

The installation procedure involves unpacking and rack mounting the device, and attaching the cable management arm (CMA) and front bezel. A separate tutorial explains attaching network cables and connecting power.

It takes approximately one hour to install an Azure FXT Edge Filer node.

This tutorial includes these setup steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Unpack the device
> * Mount the device in a rack
> * Install the front bezel (optional)

## Installation prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that the data center and rack you will use has these features:

* An available 1U slot on the rack where you intend to mount the device.
* AC power supply and cooling systems that meet the needs of the Azure FXT Edge Filer. (Read [Power and thermal specifications](specs.md#power-and-thermal-specifications) for help planning and sizing the installation.)  

  > [!NOTE]
  > To take full advantage of the two redundant power supply units (PSUs), use power distribution units on two different branch circuits when attaching AC power. Read [Connect power cables](network-power.md#connect-power-cables) for details.  

## Unpack the hardware node

Each Azure FXT Edge Filer node is shipped in a single box. Complete these steps to unpack a device.

1. Place the box on a flat, level surface.

2. Inspect the box and the packaging foam for crushes, cuts, water damage, or any other obvious damage. If the box or packaging is severely damaged, don't open it. Contact Microsoft Support to help you assess whether the device is in good working order.

3. Unpack the box. Make sure that it includes the following items:
   * One single enclosure FXT device
   * Two power cords
   * One front bezel and key
   * One rail kit assembly
   * One cable management arm (CMA)
   * CMA installation instructions booklet
   * Rack installation instructions booklet
   * Safety, Environmental, and Regulatory Information booklet

If you didn't receive all of the items listed, contact the device vendor for support.

Make sure the device has had enough time to reach the same temperature as the room before installing it or powering it on. If you notice condensation on any part of the device, wait at least 24 hours before installing.

The next step is to rack mount your device.

## Rack the device

The Azure FXT Edge Filer device must be installed in a standard 19-inch rack.

The Azure FXT Edge Filer hybrid storage cache is made up of three or more Azure FXT Edge Filer devices. Repeat the rack installation steps for each device that is part of your system.

### Rack install prerequisites

* Before you begin, read the safety instructions in the Safety, Environmental, and Regulatory Information booklet that was shipped with your device.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Always use two people when lifting the node, including when you install it in a rack or remove it from the rack.

* Identify the type of rail installation used with your equipment rack.
  * For square or round hole snap-in racks, follow the tool-less rail instructions.
  * For threaded hole racks, follow the tooled rail instructions.
  
    For the tooled rail mounting configuration, you need to supply eight screws, type 10-32, 12-24, M5, or M6. The head diameter of the screws must be less than 10 mm (0.4").

### Identify the rail kit contents

Locate the components for installing the rail kit assembly:

1. Two A7 Dell ReadyRails II sliding rail assemblies (1)
1. Two hook and loop straps (2)
