# How to safely power off Azure FXT Edge Filer hardware

> [!NOTE]
> **Action Required:** Azure FXT Edge Filer will be retired on December 31, 2026. Please remove all Azure FXT Edge Filer resources by December 31, 2026. Visit https://aka.ms/fxtretirementfaq for more information.

Although you can use the physical power button to switch on an individual node, you should not use it to shut down the unit under normal circumstances.

After an Azure FXT Edge Filer node is in use as part of a cluster, you should use the cluster control panel software to shut down the hardware.

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid possible data loss or corruption, always use the Control Panel software to shut down an Azure FXT Edge Filer. Do not use the physical power button for shutdown unless you are instructed to do so by Microsoft Customer Service and Support.
>
> In an electrical emergency, disconnect power cords or use your data center's electricity disconnect mechanism.

## Shut down a node from the Control Panel

Follow these instructions to safely power off an Azure FXT Edge Filer node:
