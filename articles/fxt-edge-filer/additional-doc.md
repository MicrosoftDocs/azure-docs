# Additional documentation for Azure FXT Edge Filer

Other non-Microsoft resources might help you understand and work with your Microsoft Azure FXT Edge Filer hybrid cache.

## Avere vFXT for Azure cache documentation

[Avere vFXT for Azure](../avere-vfxt/index.yml) is a similar cluster cache product that uses virtual nodes in Microsoft Azure. It is created with the Azure portal, but uses the same control panel configuration software as the Azure FXT Edge Filer hardware cache.

## Legacy hardware documentation

This technology was previously used in products from Avere Systems. User documentation for those older products is available on the [Avere Legacy Documentation website](https://azure.github.io/Avere/).

Specifically, these documents might have helpful details:

* [Cluster Configuration Guide](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/ops_guide/4_7/html/ops_conf_index.html) - Includes overview information about common cluster setup and management tasks, and has detailed explanations of the cluster settings pages

* [Dashboard Guide](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/dashboard/4_7/html/ops_dashboard_index.html) - Explains the features of the control panel **Dashboard** tab

* [FXT Cluster Creation Guide](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/create_cluster/4_8/html/create_index.html) - Cluster creation guide from previous products
