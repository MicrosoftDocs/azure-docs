## Convert a legacy Exchange peering to an Azure resource

As an Internet Exchange Provider, you can convert a legacy exchange peering to an Azure resource using the Azure portal: 

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***peering***. Select **Peerings** from the search results.

1. On the **Peerings** page, select **+ Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of **Create a Peering** page, enter, or select the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Project Details** |  |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource Group | Select a resource group or create a new one. |
    | **Instance details** |  |
    | Name | Enter a name for the peering you're creating. |
    | Peer ASN | Select your ASN. |

  > [!IMPORTANT]  
  > You can only choose an ASN with ValidationState as Approved before you submit a peering request. If you just submitted your PeerAsn request, wait for 12 hours or so for ASN association to be approved. If the ASN you select is pending validation, you'll see an error message. If you don't see the ASN you need to choose, check that you selected the correct subscription. If so, check if you have already created PeerAsn using **[Associate Peer ASN to Azure subscription](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129592)**.

1.  Select **Next : Configuration >**.

1. On the **Configuration** tab, enter, or select the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Peering type | Select **Exchange**. |
    | SKU | Select **Basic Free**. |
    | Metro | Select the metro location where you want to convert peering to an Azure resource. If you have peering connections with Microsoft in the selected metro location that aren't converted to an Azure resource, they'll be listed in the **Peering connections** section. |

    > You can't modify settings for legacy peering connections. If you want to add additional peering connections with Microsoft in the selected **Metro** location, select **Create new**. For more information, see [Create or modify an Exchange peering using the portal](howto-exchange-portal.md).
