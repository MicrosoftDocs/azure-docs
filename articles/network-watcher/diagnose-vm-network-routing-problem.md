# Tutorial: Diagnose a virtual machine network routing problem using the Azure portal

In this tutorial, you use Azure Network Watcher [next hop](network-watcher-next-hop-overview.md) tool to troubleshoot and diagnose a VM routing problem that's preventing it from correctly communicating with other resources. Next hop shows you that a [custom route](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md?toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json#custom-routes) caused the routing problem.

### Create second virtual machine

Follow the previous steps (1-6) and use ***myNVA*** for the virtual machine name to create the second virtual machine.

## Test network communication using Network Watcher next hop

Use the next hop capability of Network Watcher to determine which route Azure is using to route traffic from **myVM**, which has one network interface with one IP configuration

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***network watcher***. Select **Network Watcher** from the search results.

1. Under **Network diagnostic tools**, select **Next hop**. Enter or select the following values:

    | Setting | Value  |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroup**. |
    | Virtual machine | Select **myVM**. |
    | Network interface | Leave the default. |
    | Source IP address | Enter ***10.0.0.4*** or the IP of your VM if it's different. |
    | Destination IP address | Enter ***13.107.21.200*** to test the communication to `www.bing.com`. |

1. Select **Next hop** button to start the test. The test result shows information about the next hop like the next hop type, its IP address, and the route table ID used to route traffic. The result of testing **13.107.21.200** shows that the next hop type is **Internet** and the route table ID is **System Route** which means traffic destined to `www.bing.com` from **myVM** is routed to the internet using Azure default system route.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-routing-problem/next-hop-internet.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to test communication to www.bing.com using Azure Network Watcher next hop capability.":::

1. Change the **Destination IP address** to **10.0.0.5** which is the IP address of **myNVA** virtual machine, and then select **Next hop** button. The result shows that the next hop type is **VirtualNetwork** and the route table ID is **System Route** which means traffic destined to **10.0.0.5** from **myVM** is routed within **myVNet** virtual network using Azure default system route.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-routing-problem/next-hop-virtual-network.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Network Watcher next hop result when testing with an IP within the same virtual network.":::

1. Next, change the **Destination IP address** to **10.1.0.5** which is a private IP address that isn't in the address space of **myVNet** virtual network, and then select **Next hop** button. The result shows that the next hop type is **None** which means traffic destined to **10.1.0.5** from **myVM** is dropped.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-routing-problem/next-hop-none-system-route.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Network Watcher next hop result when testing with a private IP outside the address space of the virtual network.":::

## View details of a route

To further analyze routing, review the effective routes for **myVM** network interface.

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***virtual machines***. Select **Virtual machines** from the search results.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Networking**, then select the network interface.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-routing-problem/select-network-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select the network interface page from the virtual machine settings in the Azure portal.":::

1. Under **Help**, select **Effective routes** to see the all routes associated with the network interface of **myVM**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-routing-problem/effective-routes-default.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure default system routes associated with the virtual machine network interface." lightbox="./media/diagnose-vm-network-routing-problem/effective-routes-default-expanded.png":::

    In the previous section, when you ran the test using **13.107.21.200**, the route with 0.0.0.0/0 address prefix was used to route traffic to the address since no other route has the address. By default, all addresses not specified within the address prefix of another route are routed to the internet.

    When you ran the test using **10.0.0.5**, the route with 10.0.0.0/16 address prefix was used to route traffic to it.

    However, when you ran the test using **10.1.0.5**, the result was **None** for the next hop type because this IP address is in the 10.0.0.0/8 address space. Azure default route for 10.0.0.0/8 address prefix has next hope type as **None**. If you add an address prefix that contains 10.1.0.5 to the virtual network address space, then the next hop type for 10.1.0.5 will change from **None** to **VirtualNetwork**. 

## Test a routing problem due to custom routes

Next, you create a static custom route to override Azure default system routes and cause a routing problem to **myVM** virtual machine that prevents it from directly communicating with `www.bing.com`. Then, you'll use Network Watcher next hop to troubleshoot and diagnose the problem.

### Create a custom route

In this section, you create a static custom route (user-defined route) in a route table that forces all traffic destined outside the virtual network to a specific IP address. Forcing traffic to a virtual network appliance is a common scenario.

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***route tables***. Select **Route tables** from the search results.

1. Select **+ Create** to create a new route table. On the **Create Route table** page, enter, or select the following values:

    | Setting | Value  |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | **Project Details** |  |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroup**. |
    | **Instance Details** |  |
    | Region | Select **East US**. |
    | Name | Enter ***myRouteTable***. |
    | Propagate gateway routes | Leave the default. |

1. Select **Review + create**. 

1. Review the settings, and then select **Create**.

1. Once the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource** to go to the **Overview** page of **myRouteTable**.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Routes**, and then select **+ Add** to add a custom route. 

1. In the **Add route** page, enter or select the following values:

    | Setting | Value  |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | Route name | Enter ***myRoute***. |
    | Address prefix destination | Select **IP Addresses**. |
    | Destination IP addresses/CIDR ranges | Enter ***0.0.0.0/0***. |
    | Next hop type | Select **Virtual appliance**. |
    | next hop address | Enter ***10.0.0.5***. |

1. Select **Add**.

### Associate the route table with the subnet

In this section, you associate the route table that you created in the previous section with **mySubnet** subnet.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Subnets**, and then select **+ Associate** to associate **myRouteTable** with **mySubnet** subnet. 

1. In the **Associate subnet** page, select the following values:

    | Setting | Value  |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | Virtual network | Select **myVNet (myResourcegroup)**. |
    | Subnet | Select **MySubnet**. |

1. Select **OK**.

### Go to `www.bing.com`

In **myVM**, open the web browser and go to `www.bing.com` to verify if it's still reachable. The custom route that you created and associated with subnet of **myVM** forces the traffic to go to **myNVA**. The traffic is dropped as **myNVA** isn't set up to forward the traffic for the purposes of this tutorial to demonstrate a routing problem.

:::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-routing-problem/bing-blocked.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Bing page isn't reachable in a web browser.":::

###  Test network communication using next hop

Repeat the steps you used in [Test network communication using Network Watcher next hop](#test-network-communication-using-network-watcher-next-hop) section using **13.107.21.200** to test the communication to `www.bing.com`.

:::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-routing-problem/next-hop-virtual-appliance.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing virtual appliance as the next hop after applying a custom route.":::

## View effective routes

Repeat the steps you used in [View details of a route](#view-details-of-a-route) to check the effective routes after using the custom route that caused an issue in reaching `www.bing.com`.

The custom route with prefix 0.0.0.0/0 overrode Azure default route and caused all traffic destined outside **myVNet** virtual machine to go to 10.0.0.5.

> [!NOTE]
> In this tutorial, traffic to `www.bing.com` was dropped because **myNVA** was not set up to forward traffic. To learn how to set up a virtual machine to forward traffic, see [Turn on IP forwarding](/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-create-route-table-portal#turn-on-ip-forwarding).

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete **myResourceGroup** resource group and all of the resources it contains:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***myResourceGroup***. Select **myResourceGroup** from the search results.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. In **Delete a resource group**, enter ***myResourceGroup***, and then select **Delete**.

1. Select **Delete** to confirm the deletion of the resource group and all its resources.
