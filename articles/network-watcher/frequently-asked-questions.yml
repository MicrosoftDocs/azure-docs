      - question: |
          What is Network Watcher?
        answer: |
          [Network Watcher](network-watcher-overview.md) provides a suite of tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) resources, which include virtual machines, virtual networks, application gateways, load balancers, and other resources in an Azure virtual network. It isn't a solution for monitoring PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) infrastructure or getting web/mobile analytics.

      - question: |
          What tools does Network Watcher provide?
        answer: |
          Network Watcher provides three major sets of capabilities:
          * Monitoring
            * [Topology view](view-network-topology.md) shows you the resources in your virtual network and the relationships between them.
            * [Connection monitor](connection-monitor-overview.md) allows you to monitor connectivity and latency between endpoints inside and outside Azure.
          * Network diagnostic tools
            * [IP flow verify](network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview.md) allows you to detect traffic filtering issues at a virtual machine level.
            * [NSG diagnostics](nsg-diagnostics-overview.md) allows you to detect traffic filtering issues at a virtual machine, virtual machine scale set, or application gateway level.
            * [Next hop](network-watcher-next-hop-overview.md) helps you verify traffic routes and detect routing issues.
            * [Connection troubleshoot](network-watcher-connectivity-portal.md) enables a one-time connectivity and latency check between a virtual machine and Bastion host, application gateway, or another virtual machine.
            * [Packet capture](network-watcher-packet-capture-overview.md) enables you to capture your virtual machine traffic.
            * [VPN troubleshoot](network-watcher-troubleshoot-overview.md) runs multiple diagnostics checks on your VPN gateways and connections to help debug issues.
          * Traffic
            * [Network security group flow logs](network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview.md) and [virtual network flow logs](vnet-flow-logs-overview.md) allow you to log network traffic passing through your network security groups (NSGs) and virtual networks respectively.
            * [Traffic analytics](traffic-analytics.md) processes your network security group flow log data enabling you to visualize, query, analyze, and understand your network traffic.
          
          For more detailed information, see [Network Watcher overview](network-watcher-overview.md).
          
      - question: |
          How does Network Watcher pricing work?
        answer: |
          See [Network Watcher pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/network-watcher/) for pricing details about different Network Watcher components.

      - question: |
          In which regions is Network Watcher currently supported and available?
        answer: |
          See [Network Watcher regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=network-watcher) to learn about the regions that support Network Watcher.
          
      - question: |
          What permissions are required to use Network Watcher?
        answer: |
          See [Azure RBAC permissions required to use Network Watcher](required-rbac-permissions.md) for a detailed list of required permissions for each of capability of Network Watcher.
          
      - question: |
          How do I enable Network Watcher?
        answer: |
          The Network Watcher service is automatically enabled for every subscription. You must manually enable Network Watcher if you opted out Network Watcher automatic enablement. For more information, see [Enable or disable Azure Network Watcher](network-watcher-create.md).
          
      - question: |
          What is the Network Watcher deployment model?
        answer: |
          The Network Watcher parent resource is deployed with a unique instance in every region. Default naming format: NetworkWatcher_RegionName. Example: NetworkWatcher_centralus is the Network Watcher resource for the "Central US" region. You can customize the name of Network Watcher instance using [PowerShell](network-watcher-create.md?tabs=powershell#enable-network-watcher-for-your-region) or [REST API](/rest/api/network-watcher/network-watchers/create-or-update).

      - question: |
          Why does Azure allow only one instance of Network Watcher per region? 
        answer: |
          Network Watcher just needs to be enabled once per a region per a subscription for its features to work. Network Watcher is enabled in a region by creating a Network Watcher instance in that region.

      - question: |
          How can I manage Network Watcher resource? 
        answer: |
          The Network Watcher resource represents the backend service for Network Watcher, which is fully managed by Azure. However, you can create or delete the Network Watcher resource to enable or disable it in a particular region. For more information, see [Enable or disable Azure Network Watcher](network-watcher-create.md).

      - question: |
          Can I move Network Watcher instance from one region to another? 
        answer: |
          No, moving Network Watcher resource or any of its child resources across regions isn't supported. For more information, see [Move operation support for networking resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources.md#microsoftnetwork).

      - question: |
          Can I move Network Watcher instance from one resource group to another? 
        answer: |
          Yes, moving Network Watcher resource between resource groups is supported. For more information, see [Move operation support for networking resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources.md#microsoftnetwork).

      - question: |
          What is the NetworkWatcherRG?
        answer: |
          NetworkWatcherRG is a resource group that's automatically created for Network Watcher resources. For example, Network Watcher regional instances and the network security group flow log resources are created in **NetworkWatcherRG** resource group. You can customize the name of Network Watcher resource group using [PowerShell](network-watcher-create.md?tabs=powershell#enable-network-watcher-for-your-region), [Azure CLI](network-watcher-create.md?tabs=cli#enable-network-watcher-for-your-region), or [REST API](/rest/api/network-watcher/network-watchers/create-or-update).

      - question: |
          Does Network Watcher store customer data?
        answer: |
          Azure Network Watcher doesn't store customer data, except for the Connection monitor. Connection monitor stores customer data, which is automatically stored by Network Watcher in a single region to satisfy in-region data residency requirements.

      - question: |
          What are the resource limits on Network Watcher?
        answer: |
          Network Watcher has the following limits:
          [!INCLUDE [network-watcher-limits](../../includes/network-watcher-limits.md)]

  - name: Service availability and redundancy
    questions:
      - question: |
          Is the Network Watcher zone resilient?
        answer: |
          Yes, the Network Watcher service is zone-resilient by default.

      - question: |
          How do I configure the Network Watcher service to be zone-resilient?
        answer: |
          No configuration is necessary to enable zone-resiliency. Zone-resiliency for Network Watcher resources is available by default and managed by the service itself.

  - name: Network Watcher Agent
    questions:
      - question: |
          Why do I need to install the Network Watcher Agent? 
        answer: |
          The Network Watcher Agent is required for any Network Watcher feature that generates or intercepts traffic from a virtual machine. 

      - question: |
          Which features require the Network Watcher Agent?
        answer: |
          The Connection monitor, Packet capture, and Connection troubleshoot (connectivity test) features require the Network Watcher extension to be present.

      - question: |
          What is the latest version of the Network Watcher Agent?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE [Network Watcher agent version](../../includes/network-watcher-agent-version.md)]. For more information, see [Update Azure Network Watcher extension to the latest version](network-watcher-agent-update.md).

      - question: |
          What ports does the Network Watcher Agent use?
        answer: |
          - **Linux**: the Network Watcher Agent uses available ports starting from `port 50000` until it reaches `port 65535`.
          - **Windows**: the Network Watcher Agent uses the ports that the operating system responds with when queried for available ports.

      - question: |
          What IP addresses does the Network Watcher Agent communicate with?
        answer: |
          The Network Watcher Agent requires outbound TCP connectivity to `169.254.169.254` over `port 80` and `168.63.129.16` over `port 8037`. The agent uses these IP addresses to communicate with the Azure platform.

  - name: Connection monitor
    questions:
      - question: |
          Does connection monitor support classic VMs?
        answer: |
          No, connection monitor doesn't support classic VMs. For more information, see [Migrate IaaS resources from classic to Azure Resource Manager](/azure/virtual-machines/migration-classic-resource-manager-overview).

      - question: |
          What if my topology isn't decorated or my hops have missing information?
        answer: |
          Topology can be decorated from non-Azure to Azure only if the destination Azure resource and the connection monitor resource are in the same region.

      - question: |
          What happens if the connection monitor creation fails with the following error: "We don't allow creating different endpoints for the same VM"?
        answer: |
          The same Azure VM can't be used with different configurations in the same connection monitor. For example, using same VM with a filter and without a filter in the same connection monitor isn't supported.

      - question: |
          What happens if the test failure reason is "Nothing to display"?
        answer: |
          Issues that are displayed on the connection monitor dashboard are found during topology discovery or hop exploration. There can be cases where the threshold set for % loss or RTT is reached but no issues are found on hops.

      - question: |
          When migrating an existing connection monitor (classic) to the latest connection monitor, what happens if the external endpoint tests are migrated with the TCP protocol only?
        answer: |
          There's no protocol selection option in connection monitor (classic). Tests in connection monitor (classic) only use the TCP protocol, and that's why, during the migration, we create a TCP configuration in tests in the new connection monitor.

      - question: |
          Are there any limitations to using Azure Monitor and Arc Agents with connection monitor?
        answer: |
          There's currently a regional boundary when an endpoint uses Azure Monitor and Arc agents with the associated Log Analytics workspace. As a result to this limitation, the associated Log Analytics workspace must be in the same region as the Arc endpoint. Data ingested into individual workspaces can be unionized for a single view, see [Query data across Log Analytics workspaces, applications, and resources in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cross-workspace-query).

  - name: Flow logs
    questions:
      - question: |
          What does flow logging do?
        answer: |
          Flow logs enable you to log 5-tuple flow information about your Azure IP traffic that passes through a network security group or Azure virtual network. The raw flow logs are written to an Azure storage account. From there, you can further process, analyze, query, or export them as needed.

      - question: |
          Do flow logs affect network latency or performance?
        answer: |
          Flow log data is collected outside the path of your network traffic, so it doesn't affect network throughput or latency. You can create or delete flow logs without any risk of impact to network performance.

      - question: |
          What is the difference between NSG flow logs and NSG diagnostics?
        answer: |
          Network security group flow logs log traffic flowing through a network security group. On the other hand, NSG diagnostics returns all network security groups that your traffic is traversing and the rules of each network security group that are applied to this traffic. Use NSG diagnostics to verify that your network security group rules are being applied as expected.

      - question: |
          Can I log ESP and AH traffic using network security group flow logs?
        answer: |
          No, network security group flow logs don't support ESP and AH protocols.

      - question: |
          Can I log ICMP traffic using flow logs?
        answer: |
          No, network security group flow logs and virtual network flow logs don't support ICMP protocol.

      - question: |
          Can I delete a network security group that has flow logging enabled?
        answer: |
          Yes. The associated flow log resource will be deleted too. Flow log data is retained in the storage account for the retention period configured in the flow log.

      - question: |
          Can I move a network security group that has flow logging enabled to a different resource group or subscription?
        answer: |
          Yes, but you must delete the associated flow log resource. After you migrate the network security group, you can re-create the flow logs to enable flow logging on it.

      - question: |
          Can I use a storage account in a different subscription than the network security group or virtual network that the flow log is enabled for?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can use a storage account from a different subscription as long as this subscription is in the same region of the network security group and associated with the same Microsoft Entra tenant of the network security group or virtual network's subscription.

      - question: |
          How do I use network security group flow logs with a storage account behind a firewall?
        answer: |
          To use a storage account behind a firewall, you have to provide an exception for Trusted Microsoft Services to access your storage account:
          
          1. Go to the storage account by entering the storage account's name in the search box at the top of the portal.
          2. Under the **Security + networking**, select **Networking**, then select **Firewalls and virtual networks**.
          3. In **Public network access**, select **Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses**. Then under **Exceptions**, check the box next to **Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account.** 
          4. Enable network security group flow logs by creating a flow log for your target network security group using the storage account. For more information, see [Create a flow log](nsg-flow-logging.md#create-a-flow-log).
          
          You can check the storage logs after a few minutes. You should see an updated TimeStamp or a new JSON file created.

      - question: |
          Why do I see some 403 errors in storage account activity logs?
        answer: |
          Network Watcher has a built-in fallback mechanism that it uses when connecting to a storage account behind a firewall (firewall enabled). It tries to connect to the storage account using a key, and if that fails, it switches to a token. In this case, a 403 error is logged in the storage account activity log.

      - question: |
          Can Network Watcher send network security group flow logs data to a storage account enabled with Private Endpoint?
        answer: |
          Yes, Network Watcher supports sending network security group flow logs data to a storage account enabled with a private endpoint.

      - question: |
          How do I use network security group flow logs with a storage account behind a Service Endpoint?
        answer: |
          Network security group flow logs are compatible with Service Endpoints without requiring any extra configuration. For more information, see [Enable a service endpoint](../virtual-network/tutorial-restrict-network-access-to-resources.md#enable-a-service-endpoint).
          
      - question: |
          What is the difference between flow logs versions 1 and 2?
        answer: |
          Flow logs version 2 introduces the concept of *flow state* and stores information about bytes and packets transmitted. For more information, see [Network security group flow log format](network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview.md#log-format).

      - question: |
          Can I create a flow log for a network security group that has a read-only lock?
        answer: |
          No, a **read-only** lock on a network security group prevents the creation of the corresponding network security group flow log.

      - question: |
          Can I create a flow log for a network security group that has a cannot-delete lock?
        answer: |
          Yes, a **cannot-delete** lock on the network security group doesn't prevent the creation or modification of the corresponding network security group flow log.

      - question: |
          Can I automate network security group flow logs?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can automate network security group flow logs via Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates). For more information, see [Configure NSG flow logs using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template](quickstart-configure-network-security-group-flow-logs-from-arm-template.md).
