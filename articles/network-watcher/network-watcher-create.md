# Enable or disable Azure Network Watcher

Azure Network Watcher is a regional service that enables you to monitor and diagnose conditions at a network scenario level in, to, and from Azure. Scenario level monitoring enables you to diagnose problems at an end to end network level view. Network diagnostic and visualization tools available with Network Watcher help you understand, diagnose, and gain insights to your network in Azure.

Network Watcher is enabled in an Azure region through the creation of a Network Watcher instance in that region. This instance allows you to utilize Network Watcher capabilities in that particular region.

> [!NOTE]
> - By default, Network Watcher is automatically enabled. When you create or update a virtual network in your subscription, Network Watcher will be automatically enabled in your Virtual Network's region.
> - Automatically enabling Network Watcher doesn't affect your resources or associated charge.
> - If you previously chose to [opt out of Network Watcher automatic enablement](#opt-out-of-network-watcher-automatic-enablement), you must manually [enable Network Watcher](#enable-network-watcher-for-your-region) in each region where you want to use Network Watcher capabilities. For more information, see [Network Watcher Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=network-watcher&regions=all).

## Enable Network Watcher for your region

If you choose to [opt out of Network Watcher automatic enablement](#opt-out-of-network-watcher-automatic-enablement), you must manually enable Network Watcher in each region where you want to use Network Watcher capabilities. To enable Network Watcher in a region, create a Network Watcher instance in that region using the [Azure portal](?tabs=portal#enable-network-watcher-for-your-region), [PowerShell](?tabs=powershell#enable-network-watcher-for-your-region), the [Azure CLI](?tabs=cli#enable-network-watcher-for-your-region), [REST API](/rest/api/network-watcher/network-watchers/create-or-update), or an [Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.network/networkwatcher-create).


# [**Portal**](#tab/portal)

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *network watcher*. Select **Network Watcher** from the search results.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/network-watcher-portal-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to search for Network Watcher in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/network-watcher-portal-search.png":::

1. On the **Overview** page, select **+ Create**.

1. On **Add network watcher**, select your Azure subscription, then select the region that you want to enable Azure Network Watcher for.

1. Select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/network-watcher-create/create-network-watcher.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to create a Network Watcher in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/network-watcher-create/create-network-watcher.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a Network Watcher instance using the Azure portal:
> - The name of the Network Watcher instance is automatically set to **NetworkWatcher_region**, where *region* corresponds to the Azure region of the Network Watcher instance. For example, a Network Watcher enabled in the East US region is named **NetworkWatcher_eastus**.
> - The Network Watcher instance is created in a resource group named **NetworkWatcherRG**. The resource group is created if it doesn't already exist.

If you wish to customize the name of a Network Watcher instance and resource group, you can use [PowerShell](?tabs=powershell#enable-network-watcher-for-your-region) or [REST API](/rest/api/network-watcher/network-watchers/create-or-update) methods. In each option, the resource group must exist before you create a Network Watcher in it.  

# [**PowerShell**](#tab/powershell)

Create a Network Watcher instance using [New-AzNetworkWatcher](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkwatcher) cmdlet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create a resource group for the Network Watcher instance (if it doesn't already exist).
New-AzResourceGroup -Name 'NetworkWatcherRG' -Location 'eastus'

# Create an instance of Network Watcher in East US region.
New-AzNetworkWatcher -Name 'NetworkWatcher_eastus' -ResourceGroupName 'NetworkWatcherRG' -Location 'eastus'
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a Network Watcher instance using PowerShell, you can customize the name of a Network Watcher instance and resource group. However, the resource group must exist before you create a Network Watcher instance in it.

# [**Azure CLI**](#tab/cli)

Create a Network Watcher instance using [az network watcher configure](/cli/azure/network/watcher#az-network-watcher-configure) command:

```azurecli-interactive
# Create a resource group for the Network Watcher instance (if it doesn't already exist).
az group create --name 'NetworkWatcherRG' --location 'eastus'

# Create an instance of Network Watcher in East US region.
az network watcher configure --resource-group 'NetworkWatcherRG' --locations 'eastus' --enabled
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a Network Watcher instance using the Azure CLI:
> - The name of the Network Watcher instance is automatically set to **region-watcher**, where *region* corresponds to the Azure region of the Network Watcher instance. For example, a Network Watcher enabled in the East US region is named **eastus-watcher**.
> - You can customize the name of the Network Watcher resource group. However, the resource group must exist before you create a Network Watcher instance in it.

If you wish to customize the name of the Network Watcher instance, you can use [PowerShell](?tabs=powershell#enable-network-watcher-for-your-region) or [REST API](/rest/api/network-watcher/network-watchers/create-or-update) methods.
