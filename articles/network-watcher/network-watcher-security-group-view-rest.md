# Analyze your Virtual Machine security with Security Group View using REST API

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> - [PowerShell](network-watcher-security-group-view-powershell.md)

> - [REST API](network-watcher-security-group-view-rest.md)

Security group view returns configured and effective network security rules that are applied to a virtual machine. This capability is useful to audit and diagnose Network Security Groups and rules that are configured on a VM to ensure traffic is being correctly allowed or denied. In this article, we show you how to retrieve the effective and applied security rules to a virtual machine using REST API


[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Before you begin

In this scenario, you call the Network Watcher Rest API to get the security group view for a virtual machine. ARMclient is used to call the REST API using PowerShell. ARMClient is found on chocolatey at [ARMClient on Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ARMClient)

This scenario assumes you have already followed the steps in [Create a Network Watcher](network-watcher-create.md) to create a Network Watcher. The scenario also assumes that a Resource Group with a valid virtual machine exists to be used.

## Scenario

The scenario covered in this article retrieves the effective and applied security rules for a given virtual machine.

## Log in with ARMClient

```powershell
armclient login
```

## Retrieve a virtual machine

Run the following script to return a virtual machineThe following code needs variables:

- **subscriptionId** - The subscription id can also be retrieved with the **Get-AzSubscription** cmdlet.
- **resourceGroupName** - The name of a resource group that contains virtual machines.

```powershell
$subscriptionId = '<subscription id>'
$resourceGroupName = '<resource group name>'

armclient get https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/${subscriptionId}/ResourceGroups/${resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines?api-version=2015-05-01-preview
```

The information that is needed is the **id** under the type `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines` in response, as seen in the following example:

```json
...,
        "networkProfile": {
          "networkInterfaces": [
            {
              "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft
.Network/networkInterfaces/{nicName}"
            }
          ]
        },
        "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
      },
      "resources": [
        {
          "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Com
pute/virtualMachines/{vmName}/extensions/CustomScriptExtension"
        }
      ],
      "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
      "location": "westcentralus",
      "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute
/virtualMachines/{vmName}",
      "name": "{vmName}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Get security group view for virtual machine

The following example requests the security group view of a targeted virtual machine. The results from this example can be used to compare to the rules and security defined by the origination to look for configuration drift.

```powershell
$subscriptionId = "<subscription id>"
$resourceGroupName = "<resource group name>"
$networkWatcherName = "<network watcher name>"
$targetUri = "<uri of target resource>" # Example: /subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.compute/virtualMachine/$vmName

$requestBody = @"
{
    'targetResourceId': '${targetUri}'

}
"@
armclient post "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/${subscriptionId}/ResourceGroups/${resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/${networkWatcherName}/securityGroupView?api-version=2016-12-01" $requestBody -verbose
```

## View the response

The following sample is the response returned from the preceding command. The results show all the effective and applied security rules on the virtual machine broken down in groups of **NetworkInterfaceSecurityRules**, **DefaultSecurityRules**, and **EffectiveSecurityRules**.

```json
