# Traffic analytics usage scenarios

In this article, you learn how to get insights about your traffic after configuring traffic analytics in different scenarios.

## Find traffic hotspots

**Look for**

- Which hosts, subnets, virtual networks, and virtual machine scale set are sending or receiving the most traffic, traversing maximum malicious traffic and blocking significant flows?
    - Check comparative chart for hosts, subnet, virtual network, and virtual machine scale set. Understanding, which hosts, subnets, virtual networks and virtual machine scale set are sending or receiving the most traffic can help you identify the hosts that are processing the most traffic, and whether the traffic distribution is done properly.
    - You can evaluate if the volume of traffic is appropriate for a host. Is the volume of traffic normal behavior, or does it merit further investigation?
- How much inbound/outbound traffic is there?
    -   Is the host expected to receive more inbound traffic than outbound, or vice-versa?
- Statistics of blocked traffic.
    - Why is a host blocking a significant volume of benign traffic? This behavior requires further investigation and probably optimization of configuration
- Statistics of malicious allowed/blocked traffic
  - Why is a host receiving malicious traffic and why are flows from malicious sources allowed? This behavior requires further investigation and probably optimization of configuration.

    Select **See all** under **IP** as shown in the following image to see time trending for the top five talking hosts and the flow-related details (allowed â€“ inbound/outbound and denied - inbound/outbound flows) for a host:

**Look for**

- Which are the most conversing host pairs?
    - Expected behavior like front-end or back-end communication or irregular behavior, like back-end internet traffic.
- Statistics of allowed/blocked traffic
    - Why a host is allowing or blocking significant traffic volume
- Most frequently used application protocol among most conversing host pairs:
    - Are these applications allowed on this network?
    - Are the applications configured properly? Are they using the appropriate protocol for communication? Select **See all** under **Frequent conversation**, as show in the following image:

        :::image type="content" source="./media/traffic-analytics-usage-scenarios/dashboard-most-frequent-conversations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dashboard showcasing most frequent conversations." lightbox="./media/traffic-analytics-usage-scenarios/dashboard-most-frequent-conversations.png":::

**Look for**

- Which application protocol is most used in your environment, and which conversing host pairs are using the application protocol the most?
    - Are these applications allowed on this network?
    - Are the applications configured properly? Are they using the appropriate protocol for communication? Expected behavior is common ports such as 80 and 443. For standard communication, if any unusual ports are displayed, they might require a configuration change. Select **See all** under **Application port**, in the following image:

**Look for**

- Capacity utilization trends of a VPN gateway in your environment.
    - Each VPN SKU allows a certain amount of bandwidth. Are the VPN gateways underutilized?
    - Are your gateways reaching capacity? Should you upgrade to the next higher SKU?
- Which are the most conversing hosts, via which VPN gateway, over which port?
    - Is this pattern normal? Select **See all** under **VPN gateway**, as shown in the following image:

## Visualize traffic distribution by geography

**Look for**

- Traffic distribution per data center such as top sources of traffic to a datacenter, top rogue networks conversing with the data center, and top conversing application protocols.
  - If you observe more load on a data center, you can plan for efficient traffic distribution.
  - If rogue networks are conversing in the data center, then you can set network security group rules to block them.

    Select **View map** under **Your environment**, as shown in the following image:
