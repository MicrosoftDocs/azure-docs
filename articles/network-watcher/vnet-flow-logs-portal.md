# Create, change, enable, disable, or delete virtual network flow logs using the Azure portal

Virtual network flow logging is a feature of Azure Network Watcher that allows you to log information about IP traffic flowing through an Azure virtual network. For more information about virtual network flow logging, see [Virtual network flow logs overview](vnet-flow-logs-overview.md).

In this article, you learn how to create, change, enable, disable, or delete a virtual network flow log using the Azure portal. You can also learn how to manage a virtual network flow log using [PowerShell](vnet-flow-logs-powershell.md) or [Azure CLI](vnet-flow-logs-cli.md).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- Insights provider. For more information, see [Register Insights provider](#register-insights-provider).

- A virtual network. If you need to create a virtual network, see [Create a virtual network using the Azure portal](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md?toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json).

- An Azure storage account. If you need to create a storage account, see [Create a storage account using the Azure portal](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal&toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json).

## Register Insights provider

*Microsoft.Insights* provider must be registered to successfully log traffic flowing through a virtual network. If you aren't sure if the *Microsoft.Insights* provider is registered, check its status in the Azure portal by following these steps:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *subscriptions*. Select **Subscriptions** from the search results.
