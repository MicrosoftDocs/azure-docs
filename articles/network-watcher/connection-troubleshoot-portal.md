# Troubleshoot outbound connections using the Azure portal

In this article, you learn how to use the connection troubleshoot feature of Azure Network Watcher to diagnose and troubleshoot connectivity issues. For more information about connection troubleshoot, see [Connection troubleshoot overview](connection-troubleshoot-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- Network Watcher enabled in the region of the virtual machine (VM) you want to troubleshoot. By default, Azure enables Network Watcher in a region when you create a virtual network in it. For more information, see [Enable or disable Azure Network Watcher](network-watcher-create.md).

- A virtual machine with Network Watcher agent VM extension installed on it and has the following outbound TCP connectivity:
    - to 169.254.169.254 over port 80
    - to 168.63.129.16 over port 8037

- A second virtual machine with inbound TCP connectivity from 168.63.129.16 over the port being tested (for Port scanner diagnostic test).

> [!NOTE]
> When you use connection troubleshoot, Azure portal automatically installs the Network Watcher agent VM extension on the source virtual machine if it's not already installed.
> - To install the extension on a Windows virtual machine, see [Network Watcher agent VM extension for Windows](network-watcher-agent-windows.md).
> - To install the extension on a Linux virtual machine, see [Network Watcher agent VM extension for Linux](network-watcher-agent-linux.md).
> - To update an already installed extension, see [Update Network Watcher agent VM extension to the latest version](network-watcher-agent-update.md).

## Test connectivity to a virtual machine

In this section, you test the remote desktop port (RDP) connectivity from one virtual machine to another virtual machine in the same virtual network.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *network watcher*. Select **Network Watcher** from the search results.
