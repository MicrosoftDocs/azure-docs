# Manage traffic analytics using Azure Policy 

Azure Policy helps you enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale. Common use cases for Azure Policy include implementing governance for resource consistency, regulatory compliance, security, cost, and management. To learn more about Azure policy, see [What is Azure Policy?](../governance/policy/overview.md) and [Quickstart: Create a policy assignment to identify non-compliant resources](../governance/policy/assign-policy-portal.md).

In this article, you learn how to use three built-in policies available for [Azure Network Watcher traffic analytics](./traffic-analytics.md) to manage your setup.

## Audit flow logs using a built-in policy

The **Network Watcher flow logs should have traffic analytics enabled** policy audits all existing flow logs by auditing Azure Resource Manager objects of type `Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/flowLogs` and checks if traffic analytics is enabled via the `networkWatcherFlowAnalyticsConfiguration.enabled` property of the flow logs resource. This policy then flags the flow logs resource that has the property set to false.

To audit your flow logs by using the built-in policy:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *policy*. Select **Policy** from the search results. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/policy-portal-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to search for Azure Policy in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/policy-portal-search.png":::

1. Select **Assignments**, then select on **Assign Policy**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/assign-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Assign policy button in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/assign-policy.png":::

1. Select the ellipsis **...** next to **Scope** to choose your Azure subscription that has the flow logs that you want the policy to audit. You can also choose the resource group that has the flow logs. After you made your selections, select **Select** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/policy-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting the scope of the policy in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/policy-scope.png":::

1. Select the ellipsis **...** next to **Policy definition** to choose the built-in policy that you want to assign. Enter *traffic analytics* in the search box, and select **Built-in** filter. From the search results, select **Network Watcher flow logs should have traffic analytics enabled** and then select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/traffic-analytics-policy-portal/audit-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting the audit policy in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/traffic-analytics-policy-portal/audit-policy.png":::

1. Enter a name in **Assignment name** and your name in **Assigned by**. This policy doesn't require any parameters.

1. Select **Review + create** and then **Create**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This policy doesn't require any parameters. It also doesn't contain any role definitions so you don't need create role assignments for the managed identity in the **Remediation** tab.

1. Select **Compliance**. Search for the name of your assignment and then select it.

1. **Resource compliance** lists all non-compliant flow logs.

## Deploy and configure traffic analytics using *deployIfNotExists* policies 

There are two *deployIfNotExists* policies available to configure NSG flow logs:

- **Configure network security groups to use specific workspace, storage account and flow log retention policy for traffic analytics**: This policy flags the network security group that doesn't have traffic analytics enabled. For a flagged network security group, either the corresponding NSG flow logs resource doesn't exist or the NSG flow logs resource exist but traffic analytics isn't enabled on it. You can create a *remediation* task if you want the policy to affect existing resources.
 
    Remediation can be assigned while assigning policy or after policy is assigned and evaluated. Remediation enables traffic analytics on all the flagged resources with the provided parameters. If a network security group already has flow logs enabled into a particular storage ID but it doesn't have traffic analytics enabled, then remediation enables traffic analytics on this network security group with the provided parameters. If the storage ID provided in the parameters is different from the one enabled for flow logs, then the latter gets overwritten with the provided storage ID in the remediation task. If you don't want to overwrite, use **Configure network security groups to enable traffic analytics** policy.

- **Configure network security groups to enable traffic analytics**: This policy is similar to the previous policy except that during remediation, it doesn't overwrite flow logs settings on the flagged network security groups that have flow logs enabled but traffic analytics disabled with the parameter provided in the policy assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> Network Watcher is a regional service so the two *deployIfNotExists* policies will apply to network security groups that exist in a particular region. For network security groups in a different region, create another policy assignment in that region.

To assign any of the *deployIfNotExists* two policies, follow these steps: 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *policy*. Select **Policy** from the search results. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/policy-portal-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to search for Azure Policy in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/policy-portal-search.png":::

1. Select **Assignments**, and then select on **Assign policy**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/assign-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Assign policy button in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/assign-policy.png":::

1. Select the ellipsis **...** next to **Scope** to choose your Azure subscription that has the flow logs that you want the policy to audit. You can also choose the resource group that has the flow logs. After you make your selections, choose the **Select** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media//policy-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting the scope of the policy in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/policy-scope.png":::

From the search results, select **Configure network security groups to use specific workspace, storage account and flow log retention policy for traffic analytics** and then select **Add**.

## Troubleshooting

Remediation task fails with `PolicyAuthorizationFailed` error code: sample error example *The policy assignment `/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/DummyRG/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/b67334e8770a4afc92e7a929/` resource identity doesn't have the necessary permissions to create deployment.*

In such scenario, the managed identity must be manually granted access. Go to the appropriate subscription/resource group (containing the resources provided in the policy parameters) and grant contributor access to the managed identity created by the policy.
