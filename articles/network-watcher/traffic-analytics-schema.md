# Traffic analytics schema and data aggregation

Traffic analytics is a cloud-based solution that provides visibility into user and application activity in cloud networks. Traffic analytics analyzes Azure Network Watcher flow logs to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. With traffic analytics, you can:

- Visualize network activity across your Azure subscriptions and identify hot spots.
- Identify security threats, and secure your network, with information such as open-ports, applications attempting internet access, and virtual machines (VMs) connecting to rogue networks.
- Understand traffic flow patterns across Azure regions and the internet to optimize your network deployment for performance and capacity.
- Pinpoint network misconfigurations leading to failed connections in your network.
- Know network usage in bytes, packets, or flows.

## Data aggregation

# [**Network security group flow logs**](#tab/nsg)

- All flow logs at a network security group between `FlowIntervalStartTime_t` and `FlowIntervalEndTime_t` are captured at one-minute intervals as blobs in a storage account.
- Default processing interval of traffic analytics is 60 minutes, meaning that every hour, traffic analytics picks blobs from the storage account for aggregation. However, if a processing interval of 10 minutes is selected, traffic analytics will instead pick blobs from the storage account every 10 minutes.
- Flows that have the same `Source IP`, `Destination IP`, `Destination port`, `NSG name`, `NSG rule`, `Flow Direction`, and `Transport layer protocol (TCP or UDP)` are clubbed into a single flow by traffic analytics (Note: source port is excluded for aggregation).
- This single record is decorated (details in the section below) and ingested in Azure Monitor logs by traffic analytics. This process can take up to 1 hour.
- `FlowStartTime_t` field indicates the first occurrence of such an aggregated flow (same four-tuple) in the flow log processing interval between `FlowIntervalStartTime_t` and `FlowIntervalEndTime_t`.
- For any resource in traffic analytics, the flows indicated in the Azure portal are total flows seen by the network security group, but in Azure Monitor logs, user sees only the single, reduced record. To see all the flows, use the `blob_id` field,  which can be referenced from storage. The total flow count for that record matches the individual flows seen in the blob.

# [**Virtual network flow logs**](#tab/vnet)

- All flow logs between `FlowIntervalStartTime` and `FlowIntervalEndTime` are captured at one-minute intervals as blobs in a storage account.
- Default processing interval of traffic analytics is 60 minutes, meaning that every hour, traffic analytics picks blobs from the storage account for aggregation. However, if a processing interval of 10 minutes is selected, traffic analytics will instead pick blobs from the storage account every 10 minutes.
- Flows that have the same `Source IP`, `Destination IP`, `Destination port`, `NSG name`, `NSG rule`, `Flow Direction`, and `Transport layer protocol (TCP or UDP)` are clubbed into a single flow by traffic analytics (Note: source port is excluded for aggregation).
- This single record is decorated (details in the section below) and ingested in Azure Monitor logs by traffic analytics. This process can take up to 1 hour.
- `FlowStartTime` field indicates the first occurrence of such an aggregated flow (same four-tuple) in the flow log processing interval between `FlowIntervalStartTime` and `FlowIntervalEndTime`.
- For any resource in traffic analytics, the flows indicated in the Azure portal are total flows seen, but in Azure Monitor logs, user sees only the single, reduced record. To see all the flows, use the `blob_id` field,  which can be referenced from storage. The total flow count for that record matches the individual flows seen in the blob.

The following query helps you look at all subnets interacting with non-Azure public IPs in the last 30 days.

```
AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
| where SubType_s == "FlowLog" and FlowStartTime_t >= ago(30d) and FlowType_s == "ExternalPublic"
| project Subnet1_s, Subnet2_s  
```

To view the blob path for the flows in the previous query, use the following query:

```
let TableWithBlobId =
(AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
   | where SubType_s == "Topology" and ResourceType == "NetworkSecurityGroup" and DiscoveryRegion_s == Region_s and IsFlowEnabled_b
   | extend binTime = bin(TimeProcessed_t, 6h),
            nsgId = strcat(Subscription_g, "/", Name_s),
            saNameSplit = split(FlowLogStorageAccount_s, "/")
   | extend saName = iif(arraylength(saNameSplit) == 3, saNameSplit[2], '')
   | distinct nsgId, saName, binTime)
| join kind = rightouter (
   AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
   | where SubType_s == "FlowLog"  
   | extend binTime = bin(FlowEndTime_t, 6h)
) on binTime, $left.nsgId == $right.NSGList_s  
| extend blobTime = format_datetime(todatetime(FlowIntervalStartTime_t), "yyyy MM dd hh")
| extend nsgComponents = split(toupper(NSGList_s), "/"), dateTimeComponents = split(blobTime, " ")
| extend BlobPath = strcat("https://", saName,
                        "@insights-logs-networksecuritygroupflowevent/resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/", nsgComponents[0],
                        "/RESOURCEGROUPS/", nsgComponents[1],
                        "/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/", nsgComponents[2],
                        "/y=", dateTimeComponents[0], "/m=", dateTimeComponents[1], "/d=", dateTimeComponents[2], "/h=", dateTimeComponents[3],
                        "/m=00/macAddress=", replace(@"-", "", MACAddress_s),
                        "/PT1H.json")
| project-away nsgId, saName, binTime, blobTime, nsgComponents, dateTimeComponents;

TableWithBlobId
| where SubType_s == "FlowLog" and FlowStartTime_t >= ago(30d) and FlowType_s == "ExternalPublic"
| project Subnet_s , BlobPath
```

The previous query constructs a URL to access the blob directly. The URL with placeholders is as follows:

```
https://{storageAccountName}@insights-logs-networksecuritygroupflowevent/resoureId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/{subscriptionId}/RESOURCEGROUPS/{resourceGroup}/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/{networkSecurityGroupName}/y={year}/m={month}/d={day}/h={hour}/m=00/macAddress={macAddress}/PT1H.json

```

## Traffic analytics schema

Traffic analytics is built on top of Azure Monitor logs, so you can run custom queries on data decorated by traffic analytics and set alerts.

## Public IP details schema

Traffic analytics provides WHOIS data and geographic location for all public IPs in your environment. For a malicious IP, traffic analytics provides DNS domain, threat type and thread descriptions as identified by Microsoft security intelligence solutions. IP Details are published to your Log Analytics workspace so you can create custom queries and put alerts on them. You can also access prepopulated queries from the traffic analytics dashboard.

The following table details public IP schema:

## Notes

- In case of `AzurePublic` and `ExternalPublic` flows, customer owned Azure virtual machine IP is populated in `VMIP_s` field, while the Public IP addresses are populated in the `PublicIPs_s` field. For these two flow types, you should use `VMIP_s` and `PublicIPs_s` instead of `SrcIP_s` and `DestIP_s` fields. For AzurePublic and ExternalPublic IP addresses, we aggregate further, so that the number of records ingested to Log Analytics workspace is minimal. (This field will be deprecated. Use SrcIP_s and DestIP_s depending on whether the virtual machine was the source or the destination in the flow).
- Some field names are appended with `_s` or `_d`, which don't signify source and destination but indicate the data types *string* and *decimal* respectively.
- Based on the IP addresses involved in the flow, we categorize the flows into the following flow types:
    - `IntraVNet`: Both IP addresses in the flow reside in the same Azure virtual network.
    - `InterVNet`: IP addresses in the flow reside in two different Azure virtual networks.
    - `S2S` (Site-To-Site): One of the IP addresses belongs to an Azure virtual network, while the other IP address belongs to customer network (Site) connected to the virtual network through VPN gateway or ExpressRoute.
    - `P2S` (Point-To-Site): One of the IP addresses belongs to an Azure virtual network, while the other IP address belongs to customer network (Site) connected to the Azure Virtual Network through VPN gateway.
    - `AzurePublic`: One of the IP addresses belongs to an Azure virtual network, while the other IP address is an Azure Public IP address owned by Microsoft. Customer owned Public IP addresses aren't part of this flow type. For instance, any customer owned VM sending traffic to an Azure service (Storage endpoint) would be categorized under this flow type.
    - `ExternalPublic`: One of the IP addresses belongs to an Azure virtual network, while the other IP address is a public IP that is neither owned by Microsoft nor part of a customer-owned subscription visible to traffic analytics and isn't reported as malicious in the ASC feeds that traffic analytics consumes for the processing interval between `FlowIntervalStartTime_t` and `FlowIntervalEndTime_t`.
    - `MaliciousFlow`: One of the IP addresses belong to an Azure virtual network, while the other IP address is a public IP that is neither owned by Microsoft nor part of a customer-owned subscription visible to traffic analytics and is reported as malicious in the ASC feeds that traffic analytics consumes for the processing interval between `FlowIntervalStartTime_t` and `FlowIntervalEndTime_t`.
    - `UnknownPrivate`: One of the IP addresses belong to an Azure virtual network, while the other IP address belongs to the private IP range defined in RFC 1918 and couldn't be mapped by traffic analytics to a customer owned site or Azure virtual network.
    - `Unknown`: Unable to map either of the IP addresses in the flow with the customer topology in Azure and on-premises (site).

    > [!NOTE]
    > A subscription is visible to traffic analytics in a Log Analytics workspace if it contains a flow log configured to that workspace.
