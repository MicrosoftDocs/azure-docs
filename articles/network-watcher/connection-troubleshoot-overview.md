# Connection troubleshoot overview

With the increase of sophisticated and high-performance workloads in Azure, there's a critical need for increased visibility and control over the operational state of complex networks running these workloads. Such complex networks are implemented using network security groups, firewalls, user-defined routes, and resources provided by Azure. Complex configurations make troubleshooting connectivity issues challenging.

The connection troubleshoot feature of Azure Network Watcher helps reduce the amount of time to diagnose and troubleshoot network connectivity issues. The results returned can provide insights about the root cause of the connectivity problem and whether it's due to a platform or user configuration issue.

Connection troubleshoot reduces the Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) by providing a comprehensive method of performing all connection major checks to detect issues pertaining to network security groups, user-defined routes, and blocked ports. It provides the following results with actionable insights where a step-by-step guide or corresponding documentation is provided for faster resolution:

- Connectivity test with different destination types (VM, URI, FQDN, or IP Address)
- Configuration issues that impact reachability
- All possible hop by hop paths from the source to destination
- Hop by hop latency
- Latency (minimum, maximum, and average between source and destination)
- Graphical topology view from source to destination
- Number of probes failed during the connection troubleshoot check

## Supported source and destination types

Connection troubleshoot provides the capability to check TCP or ICMP connections from any of these Azure resources:

- Virtual machines
- Virtual machine scale sets
- Azure Bastion instances
- Application gateways v2 with the exception of gateways enrolled in the [Private Application Gateway deployment](../application-gateway/application-gateway-private-deployment.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Connectivity test of connection troubleshoot requires that the virtual machine you run the test from has the ***Network Watcher agent VM extension*** installed.  This extension is not required for running other connection troubleshoot tests or on the destination virtual machine.
> - To install the extension on a Windows virtual machine, see [Network Watcher agent VM extension for Windows](network-watcher-agent-windows.md).
> - To install the extension on a Linux virtual machine, see [Network Watcher agent VM extension for Linux](network-watcher-agent-linux.md).
> - To update an already installed extension, see [Update Network Watcher agent VM extension to the latest version](network-watcher-agent-update.md).

Connection troubleshoot can test connections to any of these destinations:

- Virtual machines
- Fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)
- Uniform resource identifiers (URIs)
- IP addresses

## Issues detected by connection troubleshoot

Connection troubleshoot can detect the following types of issues that can impact connectivity:

- High VM CPU utilization
- High VM memory utilization
- Virtual machine (guest) firewall rules blocking traffic
- DNS resolution failures
- Misconfigured or missing routes
- Network security group (NSG) rules that are blocking traffic
- Inability to open a socket at the specified source port
- Missing address resolution protocol entries for Azure ExpressRoute circuits
- Servers not listening on designated destination ports

The following example shows an issue found on a hop.

```json
"Issues": [

        "Origin": "Outbound",
        "Severity": "Error",
        "Type": "NetworkSecurityRule",
        "Context": [

            }
        ]
    }
]
```

## Fault types

Connection troubleshoot returns fault types about the connection. The following table provides a list of the possible returned fault types.

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| CPU | High CPU utilization. |
| Memory | High Memory utilization. |
| GuestFirewall | Traffic is blocked due to a virtual machine firewall configuration. <br><br> A TCP ping is a unique use case in which, if there's no allowed rule, the firewall itself responds to the client's TCP ping request even though the TCP ping doesn't reach the target IP address/FQDN. This event isn't logged. If there's a network rule that allows access to the target IP address/FQDN, the ping request reaches the target server and its response is relayed back to the client. This event is logged in the network rules log. |
| DNSResolution | DNS resolution failed for the destination address. |
| NetworkSecurityRule | Traffic is blocked by a network security group rule (security rule is returned). |
| UserDefinedRoute | Traffic is dropped due to a user defined or system route. |
