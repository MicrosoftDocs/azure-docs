# Tutorial: Log network traffic to and from a virtual network using the Azure portal

Virtual network flow logging is a feature of Azure Network Watcher that allows you to log information about IP traffic flowing through an Azure virtual network. For more information about virtual network flow logging, see [Virtual network flow logs](vnet-flow-logs-overview.md).

This tutorial helps you use VNet flow logs to log a virtual machine's network traffic that flows through the virtual network.

                        "flowTuples": [
                            "1754512773,10.0.0.4,13.107.21.200,49982,443,6,O,C,NX,7,1158,12,8143"                            
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The comma-separated information for **flowTuples** is as follows:

| Example data | What data represents | Explanation |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------  |
| 1754512773 | Time stamp | The time stamp of when the flow occurred in UNIX EPOCH format. In the previous example, the date converts to August 06, 2025 08:39:33 PM UTC/GMT. |
| 10.0.0.4 | Source IP address | The source IP address that the flow originated from. 10.0.0.4 is the private IP address of the VM you previously created.
| 13.107.21.200 | Destination IP address | The destination IP address that the flow was destined to. 13.107.21.200 is the IP address of `www.bing.com`. Since the traffic is destined outside Azure, the security rule **DefaultRule_AllowInternetOutBound** processed the flow. |
| 49982 | Source port | The source port that the flow originated from. |
| 443 | Destination port | The destination port that the flow was destined to. |
| 6 | Protocol | The layer 4 protocol of the flow in IANA assigned values: 6: TCP. |
| O | Direction | The direction of the flow. O: Outbound. |
| C | Flow state | The state of the flow. C: Continuing for an ongoing flow. |
| NX | Flow encryption | The connection is unencrypted. |
| 7 | Packets sent | The total number of TCP packets sent to destination since the last update. |
| 1158 | Bytes sent | The total number of TCP packet bytes sent from source to destination since the last update. Packet bytes include the packet header and payload. |
| 12 | Packets received | The total number of TCP packets received from destination since the last update. |
| 8143 | Bytes received | The total number of TCP packet bytes received from destination since the last update. Packet bytes include packet header and payload.|

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete **myResourceGroup** resource group and all of the resources it contains:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***myResourceGroup***. Select **myResourceGroup** from the search results.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. In **Delete a resource group**, enter ***myResourceGroup***, and then select **Delete**.

1. Select **Delete** to confirm the deletion of the resource group and all its resources.

> [!NOTE]
> The **NetworkWatcher_eastus/myVNet-myresourcegroup-flowlog** resource is in the **NetworkWatcherRG** resource group, but it'll be deleted after deleting the **myVNet** virtual network (by deleting the **myResourceGroup** resource group).
