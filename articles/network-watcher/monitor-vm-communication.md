# Tutorial: Monitor network communication between two virtual machines using the Azure portal

Successful communication between a virtual machine (VM) and an endpoint such as another VM, can be critical for your organization. Sometimes, configuration changes break communication.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Create a virtual network
> * Create two virtual machines
> * Monitor communication between the two virtual machines
> * Diagnose a communication problem between the two virtual machines

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.

## Create a virtual network

In this section, you create **myVNet** virtual network with two subnets and an Azure Bastion host. The first subnet is used for the virtual machine, and the second subnet is used for the Bastion host.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***virtual networks***. Select **Virtual networks** from the search results.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/virtual-networks-portal-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to search for virtual networks in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/virtual-networks-portal-search.png":::

1. Select **+ Create**. In **Create virtual network**, enter or select the following values in the **Basics** tab:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Project details** |  |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource Group | Select **Create new**. </br> Enter *myResourceGroup* in **Name**. </br> Select **OK**. |
    | **Instance details** |  |
    | Virtual network name | Enter *myVNet*. |
    | Region | Select **(US) East US**. |

1. Select the **IP Addresses** tab, or select the **Next** button at the bottom of the page twice. 

1. Accept the default IP address space **10.0.0.0/16**.

1. Select the pencil icon next to **default** subnet to rename it. Under **Subnet details** in the **Edit subnet** page, enter *mySubnet* for the **Name** and then select **Save**.

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Review the settings, and then select **Create**. 

## Create two virtual machines

In this section, you create two virtual machines: **myVM1** and **myVM2** to test the connection between them.

### Create the first virtual machine

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *virtual machine*. Select **Virtual machines** from the search results.

1. In **Virtual machines**, select **+ Create** then **+ Azure virtual machine**.

1. In the **Add test group details** page, select **Add Test Group** button.

1. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**.

## View the connection monitor

In this section, you view all the details of the connection monitor that you created in the previous section.

1. Go to the **Connection monitor** page. If you don't see **myConnectionMonitor** in the list of connection monitors, wait a few minutes, then select **Refresh**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-vm-communication/new-connection-monitor.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the new connection monitor." lightbox="./media/monitor-vm-communication/new-connection-monitor.png":::

1. Select **myConnectionMonitor** to see the performance metrics of the connection monitor like round trip time and percentage of failed checks
  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-vm-communication/connection-monitor-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the summary page of the new connection monitor." lightbox="./media/monitor-vm-communication/connection-monitor-summary.png":::

1. Select **Time Intervals** to adjust the time range to see the performance metrics for a specific time period. Available time intervals are **Last 1 hour**, **Last 6 hours**, **Last 24 hours**, **Last 7 days**, and **Last 30 days**. You can also select **Custom** to specify a custom time range.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-vm-communication/metrics-time-intervals.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows available options to change the time interval of the performance metrics in a connection monitor." lightbox="./media/monitor-vm-communication/metrics-time-intervals.png":::

## View a problem

The connection monitor you created in the previous section monitors the connection between **myVM1** and port 22 on **myVM2**. If the connection fails for any reason, connection monitor detects and logs the failure. In this section, you simulate a problem by stopping **myVM2**.

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *virtual machine*. Select **Virtual machines** from the search results.

1. In **Virtual machines**, select **myVM2**.

1. In the **Overview**, select **Stop** to stop (deallocate) **myVM2** virtual machine.

1. Go to the **Connection monitor** page. If you don't see the failure in the dashboard, select **Refresh**.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-vm-communication/connection-monitor-fail.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the failure after stopping the virtual machine." lightbox="./media/monitor-vm-communication/connection-monitor-fail.png":::

    You can see that the number of **Fail** connection monitors became **1 out of 1** after stopping **myVM2**, and under **Reason**, you can see **ChecksFailedPercent** as the reason for this failure.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete **myResourceGroup** resource group and all of the resources it contains:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***myResourceGroup***. Select **myResourceGroup** from the search results.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. In **Delete a resource group**, enter ***myResourceGroup***, and then select **Delete**.

1. Select **Delete** to confirm the deletion of the resource group and all its resources.
