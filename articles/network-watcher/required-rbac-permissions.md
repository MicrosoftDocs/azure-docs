#CustomerIntent: As an Azure administrator, I want to know the required Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) permissions to use each of the Network Watcher capabilities, so I can assign them correctly to users using any of those capabilities.

# Azure role-based access control permissions required to use Network Watcher

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) enables you to assign only the specific actions to members of your organization that they require to complete their assigned responsibilities.

To use Azure Network Watcher capabilities, the account you log into Azure with, must be assigned to the [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json#owner), [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json#contributor), or [Network contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json#network-contributor) built-in roles, or assigned to a [custom role](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md?toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json) that includes the actions listed for the Network Watcher capability that you want to use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Network contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json#network-contributor) doesn't include the following actions:
> - Microsoft.Storage/* actions listed in [Additional actions](#additional-actions) or [Flow logs](#flow-logs) section.
> - Microsoft.Compute/* actions listed in [Additional actions](#additional-actions) section.
> - Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/\*, Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules/* or Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionEndpoints/* actions listed in [Traffic analytics](#traffic-analytics) section.

To learn how to check roles assigned to a user for a subscription, see [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal.yml?toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json). If you can't see the role assignments, contact the respective subscription admin.

The following sections list the minimum required permissions to use Network Watcher and its capabilities. For a full list of related Azure permissions, see [Microsoft.Network permissions](/azure/role-based-access-control/permissions/networking#microsoftnetwork), [Microsoft.Insights permissions](/azure/role-based-access-control/permissions/monitor#microsoftinsights), and [Microsoft.OperationalInsights permissions](/azure/role-based-access-control/permissions/monitor#microsoftoperationalinsights).
