#Customer intent: I want to diagnose a virtual machine (VM) network traffic filter using IP flow verify to know which security rule is denying the traffic and causing the communication problem to the VM.

# Quickstart: Diagnose a virtual machine network traffic filter problem using the Azure CLI

In this quickstart, you deploy a virtual machine and use Network Watcher [IP flow verify](network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview.md) to test the connectivity to and from different IP addresses. Using the IP flow verify results, you determine the security rule that's blocking the traffic and causing the communication failure and learn how you can resolve it. You also learn how to use the [effective security rules](effective-security-rules-overview.md) for a network interface to determine why a security rule is allowing or denying traffic.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. 

- Azure Cloud Shell or Azure CLI.

    The steps in this article run the Azure CLI commands interactively in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview). To run the commands in the Cloud Shell, select **Open Cloud Shell** at the upper-right corner of a code block. Select **Copy** to copy the code, and paste it into Cloud Shell to run it. You can also run the Cloud Shell from within the Azure portal.

    You can also [install Azure CLI locally](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to run the commands. This quickstart requires version 2.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If you run Azure CLI locally, sign in to Azure using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command.
 
## Create a virtual machine

In this section, you create a virtual network and a subnet in the East US region. Then, you create a virtual machine in the subnet with a default network security group.

1. Create a resource group using [az group create](/cli/azure/group). An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Create a resource group.
    az group create --name 'myResourceGroup' --location 'eastus'
    ```

1. Create a virtual network using [az network vnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet#az-network-vnet-create).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Create a virtual network and a subnet.
    az network vnet create --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --name 'myVNet' --subnet-name 'mySubnet' --subnet-prefixes 10.0.0.0/24 
    ```

1. Create a default network security group using [az network nsg create](/cli/azure/network/nsg#az-network-nsg-create).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Create a default network security group.
    az network nsg create --name 'myVM-nsg' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --location 'eastus'
    ```

1. Create a virtual machine using [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create). When prompted, enter a username and password.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Create a Linux virtual machine using the latest Ubuntu 20.04 LTS image.
    az vm create --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --name 'myVM' --location 'eastus' --vnet-name 'myVNet' --subnet 'mySubnet' --public-ip-address '' --nsg 'myVM-nsg' --image 'Canonical:0001-com-ubuntu-server-focal:20_04-lts-gen2:latest'
    ```

## Test network communication using IP flow verify

In this section, you use the IP flow verify capability of Network Watcher to test network communication to and from the virtual machine.

1. Use [az network watcher test-ip-flow](/cli/azure/network/watcher#az-network-watcher-test-ip-flow) command to test outbound communication from **myVM** to **13.107.21.200** using IP flow verify (`13.107.21.200` is one of the public IP addresses used by `www.bing.com`):


    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Start the IP flow verify session to test outbound flow to www.bing.com.
    az network watcher test-ip-flow --direction 'outbound' --protocol 'TCP' --local '10.0.0.4:60000' --remote '13.107.21.200:80' --vm 'myVM' --nic 'myVmVMNic' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --out 'table'
    ```

    After a few seconds, you get a similar output to the following example:

    ```output
    Access  RuleName
    ------  --------
    Allow   defaultSecurityRules/AllowInternetOutBound
    ```

    The test result indicates that access is allowed to **13.107.21.200** because of the default security rule **AllowInternetOutBound**. By default, Azure virtual machines can access the internet.

1. Change **RemoteIPAddress** to **10.0.1.10** and repeat the test. **10.0.1.10** is a private IP address in **myVNet** address space. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Start the IP flow verify session to test outbound flow to 10.0.1.10.
    az network watcher test-ip-flow --direction 'outbound' --protocol 'TCP' --local '10.0.0.4:60000' --remote '10.0.1.10:80' --vm 'myVM' --nic 'myVmVMNic' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --out 'table'
    ```

    After a few seconds, you get a similar output to the following example:

    ```output
    Access RuleName
    ------ --------
    Allow  defaultSecurityRules/AllowVnetOutBound
    ```

    The result of the second test indicates that access is allowed to **10.0.1.10** because of the default security rule **AllowVnetOutBound**. By default, an Azure virtual machine can access all IP addresses in the address space of its virtual network.

1. Change **RemoteIPAddress** to **10.10.10.10** and repeat the test. **10.10.10.10** is a private IP address that isn't in **myVNet** address space.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Start the IP flow verify session to test outbound flow to 10.10.10.10.
    az network watcher test-ip-flow --direction 'outbound' --protocol 'TCP' --local '10.0.0.4:60000' --remote '10.10.10.10:80' --vm 'myVM' --nic 'myVmVMNic' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --out 'table'
    ```

    After a few seconds, you get a similar output to the following example:
    
    ```output
    Access RuleName
    ------ --------
    Allow  defaultSecurityRules/DenyAllOutBound
    ```

    The result of the third test indicates that access is denied to **10.10.10.10** because of the default security rule **DenyAllOutBound**.

1. Change **direction** to **inbound**, the local port to **80**, and the remote port to **60000**, and then repeat the test. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Start the IP flow verify session to test inbound flow from 10.10.10.10.
    az network watcher test-ip-flow --direction 'inbound' --protocol 'TCP' --local '10.0.0.4:80' --remote '10.10.10.10:6000' --vm 'myVM' --nic 'myVmVMNic' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --out 'table'
    ```

    After a few seconds, you get similar output to the following example:
    
    ```output
    Access RuleName
    ------ --------
    Allow  defaultSecurityRules/DenyAllInBound
    ```

    The result of the fourth test indicates that access is denied from **10.10.10.10** because of the default security rule **DenyAllInBound**. By default, all access to an Azure virtual machine from outside the virtual network is denied.

## View details of a security rule

To determine why the rules in the previous section allow or deny communication, review the effective security rules for the network interface of **myVM** virtual machine using the [az network nic list-effective-nsg](/cli/azure/network/nic#az-network-nic-list-effective-nsg) command:

```azurecli-interactive
# Get the effective security rules for the network interface of myVM.
az network nic list-effective-nsg --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --name 'myVmVMNic'
```

The returned output includes the following information for the **AllowInternetOutbound** rule that allowed outbound access to `www.bing.com`:


```output
{
  "access": "Allow",
  "destinationAddressPrefix": "Internet",
  "destinationAddressPrefixes": [
	"Internet"
  ],
  "destinationPortRange": "0-65535",
  "destinationPortRanges": [
	"0-65535"
  ],
  "direction": "Outbound",
  "expandedDestinationAddressPrefix": [
	"1.0.0.0/8",
	"2.0.0.0/7",
	"4.0.0.0/9",
	"4.144.0.0/12",
	"4.160.0.0/11",
	"4.192.0.0/10",
	"5.0.0.0/8",
	"6.0.0.0/7",
	"8.0.0.0/7",
	"11.0.0.0/8",
	"12.0.0.0/8",
	"13.0.0.0/10",
	"13.64.0.0/11",
	"13.104.0.0/13",
	"13.112.0.0/12",
	"13.128.0.0/9",
	"14.0.0.0/7",
	...
	...
	...
	"200.0.0.0/5",
	"208.0.0.0/4"
  ],
  "name": "defaultSecurityRules/AllowInternetOutBound",
  "priority": 65001,
  "protocol": "All",
  "sourceAddressPrefix": "0.0.0.0/0",
  "sourceAddressPrefixes": [
	"0.0.0.0/0",
	"0.0.0.0/0"
  ],
  "sourcePortRange": "0-65535",
  "sourcePortRanges": [
	"0-65535"
  ]
},
```

You can see in the output that address prefix **13.104.0.0/13** is among the address prefixes of **AllowInternetOutBound** rule. This prefix encompasses the IP address **13.107.21.200**, which you utilized to test outbound communication to `www.bing.com`.

Similarly, you can check the other rules to see the source and destination IP address prefixes under each rule.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, use [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) to delete **myResourceGroup** resource group and all of the resources it contains:

```azurecli-interactive
# Delete the resource group and all resources it contains.
az group delete --name 'myResourceGroup' --yes
```
