# Quickstart: Diagnose a virtual machine network traffic filter problem using the Azure portal

In this quickstart, you deploy a virtual machine and use Network Watcher [IP flow verify](network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview.md) to test the connectivity to and from different IP addresses. Using the IP flow verify results, you determine the security rule that's blocking the traffic and causing the communication failure and learn how you can resolve it. You also learn how to use the [effective security rules](effective-security-rules-overview.md) for a network interface to determine why a security rule is allowing or denying traffic.

## Test network communication using IP flow verify

In this section, you use the IP flow verify capability of Network Watcher to test network communication to and from the virtual machine. 

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *network watcher*. Select **Network Watcher** from the search results.

1. Under **Network diagnostic tools**, select **IP flow verify**.

1. In the **IP flow verify** page, enter, or select the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | **Target resource** |  |
    | Virtual machine   | Select **myVM** virtual machine. |
    | Network interface | Select the network interface of **myVM**. When you use the Azure portal to create a virtual machine, the portal names the network interface using the virtual machine's name and a random number (for example myvm36). |
    | **Packet details** |  |
    | Protocol | Select **TCP**. |
    | Direction | Select **Outbound**. |
    | Local port | Enter *60000*. Choose any port number from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) range for dynamic or private ports. |
    | Remote IP address | Enter *13.107.21.200*. This IP address is one of the IP addresses of `www.bing.com` website. |
    | Remote port | Enter *80* |

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the virtual machine in the list of virtual machines available to select, make sure that it's running. Stopped virtual machines aren't available to select for IP flow verify test.

1. Select **Verify IP flow** button. 

    After a few seconds, you can see the test result, which indicates that access is allowed to **13.107.21.200** because of the default security rule **AllowInternetOutBound**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem/ip-flow-verify-first-test-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the result of IP flow verify to IP address 13.107.21.200." lightbox="./media/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem/ip-flow-verify-first-test-results.png":::

1. Change **Remote IP address** to **10.0.1.10**, which is a private IP address in **myVNet** address space. Then, repeat the test by selecting **Verify IP flow** button again. The result of the second test indicates that access is allowed to **10.0.1.10** because of the default security rule **AllowVnetOutBound**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem/ip-flow-verify-second-test-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the result of IP flow verify to IP address 10.0.1.10." lightbox="./media/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem/ip-flow-verify-second-test-results.png":::

1. Change **Remote IP address** to **10.10.10.10** and repeat the test. The result of the third test indicates that access is denied to **10.10.10.10** because of the default security rule **DenyAllOutBound**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem/ip-flow-verify-third-test-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the result of IP flow verify to IP address 10.10.10.10." lightbox="./media/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem/ip-flow-verify-third-test-results.png":::

1. Change **Direction** to **Inbound**, the **Local port** to **80**, and the **Remote port** to **60000**, and then repeat the test. The result of the fourth test indicates that access is denied from **10.10.10.10** because of the default security rule **DenyAllInBound**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem/ip-flow-verify-fourth-test-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the result of IP flow verify from IP address 10.10.10.10." lightbox="./media/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem/ip-flow-verify-fourth-test-results.png":::

## View details of a security rule

To determine why the rules in the previous section allow or deny communication, review the effective security rules for the network interface in **myVM** virtual machine.

1. Under **Network diagnostic tools** in **Network Watcher**, select **Effective security rules**.

1. Select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource Group | Select **myResourceGroup**. |
    | Virtual machine | Select **myVM**. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > **myVM** virtual machine has one network interface that will be selected once you select **myVM**. If your virtual machine has more than one network interface, choose the one that you want to see its effective security rules. 
   
    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem/effective-security-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Effective security rules in Network Watcher." lightbox="./media/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem/effective-security-rules.png" :::

1. Under **Outbound rules**, select **AllowInternetOutBound** to see the allowed destination IP address prefixes under this security rule.

    You can see that address prefix **13.104.0.0/13** is among the address prefixes of **AllowInternetOutBound** rule. This prefix encompasses IP address **13.107.21.200** which you tested in step 4 of previous section.

    Similarly, you can check the other rules to see the source and destination IP address prefixes under each rule. 

IP flow verify checks Azure default and configured security rules. If the checks return the expected results and you still have network problems, ensure that you don't have a firewall between your virtual machine and the endpoint you're communicating with and that the operating system in your virtual machine doesn't have a firewall that is denying communication.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group and all of the resources it contains:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***myResourceGroup***. Select **myResourceGroup** from the search results.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. In **Delete a resource group**, enter ***myResourceGroup***, and then select **Delete**.

1. Select **Delete** to confirm the deletion of the resource group and all its resources.
