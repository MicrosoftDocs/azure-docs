# Start, stop, download, and delete packet captures with Azure Network Watcher

In this article, you learn how to use the Azure Network Watcher [packet capture](packet-capture-overview.md) feature to remotely configure, start, stop, download, and delete packet captures.

## Prerequisites

# [**Portal**](#tab/portal)

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- A virtual machine (VM) or virtual machine scale set with outbound TCP connectivity to: `169.254.169.254` over port `80` and `168.63.129.16` over port `8037`. The Network Watcher agent VM extension uses these IP addresses to communicate with the Azure platform.

- Network Watcher Agent VM extension installed on the target virtual machine. Whenever you use Network Watcher packet capture in the Azure portal, the agent is automatically installed on the target VM or scale set if it wasn't previously installed. To update an already installed agent, see [Update Azure Network Watcher extension to the latest version](network-watcher-agent-update.md).

- An Azure storage account with VM outbound TCP connectivity to it over port `443`. If you don't have a storage account, see [Create a storage account using the Azure portal](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal&toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json). The storage account must be accessible from the subnet of the target virtual machine or scale set. For more information, see [Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md?tabs=azure-portal&toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json).

- Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.

# [**PowerShell**](#tab/powershell)

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- A virtual machine (VM) with outbound TCP connectivity to: `169.254.169.254` over port `80` and `168.63.129.16` over port `8037`. The Network Watcher agent VM extension uses these IP addresses to communicate with the Azure platform.

- Network Watcher Agent VM extension installed on the target virtual machine. For more information, see [Manage Network Watcher Agent VM extension for Windows](network-watcher-agent-windows.md?tabs=powershell) or [Manage Network Watcher Agent VM extension for Linux](network-watcher-agent-linux.md?tabs=powershell).

- An Azure storage account with VM outbound TCP connectivity to it over port `443`. If you don't have a storage account, see [Create a storage account using PowerShell](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-powershell&toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json). The storage account must be accessible from the subnet of the target virtual machine or scale set. For more information, see [Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md?tabs=azure-powershell&toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json).

- Azure Cloud Shell or Azure PowerShell.

    The steps in this article run the Azure PowerShell cmdlets interactively in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview). To run the commands in the Cloud Shell, select **Open Cloud Shell** at the upper-right corner of a code block. Select **Copy** to copy the code and then paste it into Cloud Shell to run it. You can also run the Cloud Shell from within the Azure portal.

    You can also install Azure PowerShell locally to run the cmdlets. This article requires the Az PowerShell module. For more information, see [How to install Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell). If you run PowerShell locally, sign in to Azure using the [Connect-AzAccount](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount) cmdlet.

# [**Azure CLI**](#tab/cli)

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- A virtual machine (VM) with outbound TCP connectivity to: `169.254.169.254` over port `80` and `168.63.129.16` over port `8037`. The Network Watcher agent VM extension uses these IP addresses to communicate with the Azure platform.

- Network Watcher Agent VM extension installed on the target virtual machine. For more information, see [Manage Network Watcher Agent VM extension for Windows](network-watcher-agent-windows.md?tabs=cli) or [Manage Network Watcher Agent VM extension for Linux](network-watcher-agent-linux.md?tabs=cli).

- An Azure storage account with VM outbound TCP connectivity to it over port `443`. If you don't have a storage account, see [Create a storage account using the Azure CLI](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-cli&toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json). The storage account must be accessible from the subnet of the target virtual machine or scale set. For more information, see [Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md?tabs=azure-cli&toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json).

- Azure Cloud Shell or Azure CLI.

    The steps in this article run the Azure CLI commands interactively in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview). To run the commands in the Cloud Shell, select **Open Cloud Shell** at the upper-right corner of a code block. Select **Copy** to copy the code, and paste it into Cloud Shell to run it. You can also run the Cloud Shell from within the Azure portal.

    You can also [install Azure CLI locally](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to run the commands. If you run Azure CLI locally, sign in to Azure using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command.

---

> [!NOTE]
> Azure creates a Network Watcher instance in the virtual machine's region if Network Watcher wasn't enabled for that region. For more information, see [Enable or disable Azure Network Watcher](network-watcher-create.md).

If a network security group is associated to the network interface, or subnet that the network interface is in, ensure that rules exist to allow outbound connectivity over the previous ports. Similarly, ensure outbound connectivity over the previous ports when adding user-defined routes to your network.

1. The packet capture stops once the time limit or the file size (maximum bytes per session) is reached.

# [**PowerShell**](#tab/powershell)

To start a capture session, use [New-AzNetworkWatcherPacketCapture](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkwatcherpacketcapture) cmdlet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Place the virtual machine configuration into a variable.
$vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -Name 'myVM'

# Place the storage account configuration into a variable.
$storageAccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -Name 'mystorageaccount'

# Start the Network Watcher capture session.
New-AzNetworkWatcherPacketCapture -Location 'eastus' -PacketCaptureName 'myVM_1' -TargetVirtualMachineId $vm.Id  -StorageAccountId $storageAccount.Id 
```

Once the capture session is started, you see the following output:

```output
ProvisioningState Name   BytesToCapturePerPacket TotalBytesPerSession TimeLimitInSeconds
----------------- ----   ----------------------- -------------------- ------------------
Succeeded         myVM_1 0                       1073741824           18000

## Stop a packet capture

# [**Portal**](#tab/portal)

To manually stop a packet capture session before it reaches its time or file size limits, select the ellipsis **...** on the right-side of the packet capture, or right-click it, then select **Stop**.
 
:::image type="content" source="./media/packet-capture-manage/stop-packet-capture.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to stop a packet capture in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/packet-capture-manage/stop-packet-capture.png":::

# [**PowerShell**](#tab/powershell)

To manually stop a packet capture session before it reaches its time or file size limits, use the [Stop-AzNetworkWatcherPacketCapture](/powershell/module/az.network/stop-aznetworkwatcherpacketcapture) cmdlet.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Manually stop a packet capture session.
Stop-AzNetworkWatcherPacketCapture -Location 'eastus' -PacketCaptureName 'myVM_1'
```

> [!NOTE]
> The cmdlet doesn't return a response whether ran on a currently running capture session or a session that has already stopped.

# [**Azure CLI**](#tab/cli)

To manually stop a packet capture session before it reaches its time or file size limits, use the [az network watcher packet-capture stop](/cli/azure/network/watcher/packet-capture#az-network-watcher-packet-capture-stop) command.

```azurecli-interactive
# Manually stop a packet capture session.
az network watcher packet-capture stop --location 'eastus' --name 'myVM_1'
```

> [!NOTE]
> The command doesn't return a response whether ran on a currently running capture session or a session that has already stopped.

## View packet capture status

# [**Portal**](#tab/portal)

Go to the **Packet capture** page of Network Watcher to list existing packet captures regardless of their status.

:::image type="content" source="./media/packet-capture-manage/view-packet-capture.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to list and see packet captures in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/packet-capture-manage/view-packet-capture.png":::

# [**PowerShell**](#tab/powershell)

Use [Get-AzNetworkWatcherPacketCapture](/powershell/module/az.network/get-aznetworkwatcherpacketcapture) cmdlet to retrieve the status of a packet capture (running or completed).

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Get information, properties, and status of a packet capture.
Get-AzNetworkWatcherPacketCapture -Location 'eastus' -PacketCaptureName 'myVM_1'
```

The following output is an example of the output from the `Get-AzNetworkWatcherPacketCapture` cmdlet. The following example is after the capture is complete. The PacketCaptureStatus value is Stopped, with a StopReason of TimeExceeded. This value shows that the packet capture was successful and ran its time.

```output
ProvisioningState Name   Target                                                                                                                              BytesToCapturePerPacket TotalBytesPerSession TimeLimitInSeconds
----------------- ----   ------                                                                                                                              ----------------------- -------------------- ------------------
Succeeded         myVM_1 /subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM 0                       1073741824           18000
```

> [!NOTE]
> To get more details in the output, add `| Format-List` to the end of the command.

# [**Azure CLI**](#tab/cli)

Use [az network watcher packet-capture show-status](/cli/azure/network/watcher/packet-capture#az-network-watcher-packet-capture-show-status) command to retrieve the status of a packet capture (running or completed).

```azurecli-interactive
# Get information, properties, and status of a packet capture.
az network watcher packet-capture show-status --location 'eastus' --name 'myVM_1'
```

The following example is the output from the `az network watcher packet-capture show-status` command. You can see that packetCaptureStatus value is **Stopped**, with a StopReason value of **TimeExceeded**:

```output
{
  "additionalProperties": {
    "status": "Succeeded"
  },
  "captureStartTime": "2016-12-06T17:20:01.5671279Z",
  "id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/NetworkWatcherRG/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/NetworkWatcher_eastus/packetCaptures/myVM_1",
  "name": "packetCaptureName",
  "packetCaptureError": [],
  "packetCaptureStatus": "Stopped",
  "stopReason": "TimeExceeded"
}
```

## Download a packet capture

After your packet capture session completes, the resulting capture file is saved to Azure Storage, a local file on the target virtual machine, or both. The storage destination for the packet capture is specified during its creation. For more information, see [Start a packet capture](#start-a-packet-capture) section.

# [**Portal**](#tab/portal)

To download a packet capture file saved to Azure storage, follow these steps:

1. In the **Packet capture** page, select the packet capture that you want to download its file.

1. In the **Details** section, select the packet capture file link.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/packet-capture-manage/packet-capture-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select the packet capture file in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/packet-capture-manage/packet-capture-file.png":::

1. In the blob page, select **Download**.


You can also download capture files by directly going to the storage account container at the following path: 
```
https://{storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/network-watcher-logs/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{storageAccountResourceGroup}/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/{virtualMachineName}/{year}/{month}/{day}/packetcapture_{UTCcreationTime}.cap
```

# [**PowerShell**](#tab/powershell)

If a storage account is specified, capture files are saved to the storage account at the following path:

```url
https://{storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/network-watcher-logs/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{storageAccountResourceGroup}/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/{virtualMachineName}/{year}/{month}/{day}/packetcapture_{UTCcreationTime}.cap
```

To download a packet capture from Azure storage to the local disk, use [Get-AzStorageBlobContent](/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageblobcontent) cmdlet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Download the packet capture file from Azure storage container.
Get-AzStorageBlobContent -Container 'network-watcher-logs' -Blob '/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/myresourcegroup/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/myvm/2024/01/25/packetcapture_22_44_54_342.cap' -Destination 'C:\Capture\myVM_1.cap'
```

# [**Azure CLI**](#tab/cli)

If a storage account is specified, capture files are saved to the storage account at the following path:

```url
https://{storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/network-watcher-logs/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{storageAccountResourceGroup}/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/{virtualMachineName}/{year}/{month}/{day}/packetcapture_{UTCcreationTime}.cap
```

To download a packet capture from Azure storage to the local disk, use [az storage blob download](/cli/azure/storage/blob#az-storage-blob-download) command:

```azurecli-interactive
# Download the packet capture file from Azure storage container.
az storage blob download --container-name 'network-watcher-logs' --blob-url '/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/myresourcegroup/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/myvm/2024/01/25/packetcapture_22_44_54_342.cap' --file 'C:\Capture\myVM_1.cap'
```

---

> [!NOTE]
> You can use Azure Storage Explorer to download capture files from the storage account container. Storage Explorer is a standalone app that you can conveniently use to access and work with Azure Storage data. For more information, see [Get started with Storage Explorer](../vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the packet capture session, the capture file might not immediately appear in the storage account container because it's initially saved to a temporary location. The file is transferred to its final location after the capture session is completed.

To download a packet capture file saved to the virtual machine (VM), connect to the VM and download the file from the local path specified during the packet capture creation. 

## Delete a packet capture

# [**Portal**](#tab/portal)

1. In the **Packet capture** page, select **...** on the right-side of the packet capture that you want to delete, or right-click it, then select **Delete**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/packet-capture-manage/delete-packet-capture.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to delete a packet capture from Network Watcher in Azure portal." lightbox="./media/packet-capture-manage/delete-packet-capture.png":::

1. Select **Yes**.

# [**PowerShell**](#tab/powershell)

Use [Remove-AzNetworkWatcherPacketCapture](/powershell/module/az.network/remove-aznetworkwatcherpacketcapture) to delete a packet capture resource.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Delete a packet capture resource.
Remove-AzNetworkWatcherPacketCapture -Location 'eastus' -PacketCaptureName 'myVM_1'
```
# [**Azure CLI**](#tab/cli)

Use [az network watcher packet-capture delete](/cli/azure/network/watcher/packet-capture#az-network-watcher-packet-capture-delete) to delete a packet capture resource.

```azurecli-interactive
# Delete a packet capture resource.
az network watcher packet-capture delete --location 'eastus' --name 'myVM_1'
```

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting the packet capture resource in Network Watcher doesn't delete the capture file from the storage account or the virtual machine. If you don't need the capture file anymore, you must manually delete it from the storage account or virtual machine.
