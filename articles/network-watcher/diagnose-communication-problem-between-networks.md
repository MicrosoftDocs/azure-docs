    | Region | Select **(US) East US**. |
    | Performance | Select **Standard**. |
    | Redundancy | Select **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**. |

1. Select the **Review** tab or select the **Review** button.

1. Review the settings, and then select **Create**.

1. Once the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource** to go to the **Overview** page of **mynwstorageaccount**.

1. Under **Data storage**, select **Containers**.

1. Select **+ Container**.

1. In **New container**, enter or select the following values then select **Create**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | Enter ***vpn***. |
    | Public access level | Select **Private (no anonymous access)**. |

## Create gateway connections

After creating **VNet1GW** and **VNet2GW** virtual network gateways, you can create connections between them to allow communication over secure IPsec/IKE tunnel between **VNet1** and **VNet2** virtual networks. To create the IPsec/IKE tunnel, you create two connections:

- From **VNet1** to **VNet2**
- From **VNet2** to **VNet1**

### Create first connection

1. Go to **VNet1GW** gateway.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Connections**.

1. Select **+ Add** to create a connection from **VNet1** to **VNet2**.

1. In **Create connection**, enter or select the following values in the **Basics** tab:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Project details** |  |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource Group | Select **myResourceGroup**. |
    | **Instance details** |  |
    | Connection type | Select **VNet-to-VNet**. |
    | Name | Enter ***to-VNet2***. |
    | Region | Select **East US**. |

1. Select the **Settings** tab or select **Next: Settings** button.

1. In **Settings** tab, enter or select the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Virtual network gateway** |  |
    | First virtual network gateway | Select **VNet1GW**. |
    | Second virtual network gateway | Select **VNet2GW**. |
    | Shared key (PSK) | Enter ***123***. |

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Review the settings, and then select **Create**.

### Create second connection

1. Go to **VNet2GW** gateway.

1. Create the second connection by following the previous steps you used to create the first connection with the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | **to-VNet1** |
    | First virtual network gateway | **VNet2GW** |
    | Second virtual network gateway | **VNet1GW** |
    | Shared key (PSK) | **000** |

    > [!NOTE]
    > To successfully create an IPsec/IKE tunnel between two Azure VPN gateways, the connections between the gateways must use identical shared keys. In the previous steps, two different keys were used to create a problem with the gateway connections.

## Diagnose the VPN problem

In this section, you use Network Watcher VPN troubleshoot to check the two VPN gateways and their connections.

1. Under **Settings** of **VNet2GW** gateway, select **Connection**. 

1. Select **Refresh** to see the connections and their current status, which is **Not connected** (because of mismatch between the shared keys).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-communication-problem-between-networks/second-gateway-connections-not-connected.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the gateway connections in the Azure portal and their not connected status.":::

1. Under **Help** of **VNet2GW** gateway, select **VPN troubleshoot**.

1. Select **Select storage account** to choose the storage account and the container that you want to save the logs to.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-communication-problem-between-networks/second-gateway-vpn-troubleshoot-not-started.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows vpn troubleshoot in the Azure portal before troubleshooting started.":::

1. From the list, select **VNet1GW** and **VNet2GW**, and then select **Start troubleshooting** to start checking the gateways.

1. Once the check is completed, the troubleshooting status of both gateways changes to **Unhealthy**. Select a gateway to see more details under **Status** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-communication-problem-between-networks/gateway-unhealthy.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the status of a gateway and results of VPN troubleshoot test in the Azure portal after troubleshooting completed.":::

1. Because the VPN tunnels are disconnected, select the connections, and then select **Start troubleshooting** to start checking them.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can troubleshoot gateways and their connections in one step. However, checking only the gateways takes less time and based on the result, you decide if you need to check the connections.

1. Once the check is completed, the troubleshooting status of the connections changes to **Unhealthy**. Select a connection to see more details under **Status** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-communication-problem-between-networks/connection-unhealthy.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the status of a connection and results of VPN troubleshoot test in the Azure portal after troubleshooting completed.":::

    VPN troubleshoot checked the connections and found a mismatch in the shared keys.

## Fix the problem and verify using VPN troubleshoot

### Fix the problem

Fix the problem by correcting the key on **to-VNet1** connection to match the key on **to-VNet2** connection. 

1. Go to **to-VNet1** connection.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Authentication Type**.

1. In **Shared key (PSK)**, enter ***123*** and then select **Save**.
