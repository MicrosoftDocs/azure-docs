# Tutorial: Log network traffic to and from a virtual machine using the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [NSG flow logs retirement](../../includes/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logs-retirement.md)]

Network security group flow logging is a feature of Azure Network Watcher that allows you to log information about IP traffic flowing through a network security group. For more information about network security group flow logging, see [NSG flow logs overview](nsg-flow-logs-overview.md).

This tutorial helps you use NSG flow logs to log a virtual machine's network traffic that flows through the [network security group](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md) associated to its network interface.

## View the flow log

Open the downloaded `PT1H.json` file using a text editor of your choice. The following example is a section taken from the downloaded `PT1H.json` file, which shows a flow processed by the rule **DefaultRule_AllowInternetOutBound**.

```json
{
    "time": "2023-02-26T23:45:44.1503927Z",
    "systemId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "macAddress": "112233445566",
    "category": "NetworkSecurityGroupFlowEvent",
    "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/RESOURCEGROUPS/MYRESOURCEGROUP/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/MYVM-NSG",
    "operationName": "NetworkSecurityGroupFlowEvents",
    "properties": {
        "Version": 2,
        "flows": [
            {
                "rule": "DefaultRule_AllowInternetOutBound",
                "flows": [
                    {
                        "mac": "112233445566",
                        "flowTuples": [
                            "1677455097,10.0.0.4,13.107.21.200,49982,443,T,O,A,C,7,1158,12,8143"                            
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The comma-separated information for **flowTuples** is as follows:

| Example data | What data represents | Explanation |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------  |
| 1677455097 | Time stamp | The time stamp of when the flow occurred in UNIX EPOCH format. In the previous example, the date converts to February 26, 2023 11:44:57 PM UTC/GMT. |
| 10.0.0.4 | Source IP address | The source IP address that the flow originated from. 10.0.0.4 is the private IP address of the VM you previously created.
| 13.107.21.200 | Destination IP address | The destination IP address that the flow was destined to. 13.107.21.200 is the IP address of `www.bing.com`. Since the traffic is destined outside Azure, the security rule **DefaultRule_AllowInternetOutBound** processed the flow. |
| 49982 | Source port | The source port that the flow originated from. |
| 443 | Destination port | The destination port that the flow was destined to. |
| T | Protocol | The protocol of the flow. T: TCP. |
| O | Direction | The direction of the flow. O: Outbound. |
| A | Decision | The decision made by the security rule. A: Allowed. |
| C | Flow State **Version 2 only** | The state of the flow. C: Continuing for an ongoing flow. |
| 7 | Packets sent **Version 2 only** | The total number of TCP packets sent to destination since the last update. |
| 1158 | Bytes sent **Version 2 only** | The total number of TCP packet bytes sent from source to destination since the last update. Packet bytes include the packet header and payload. |
| 12 | Packets received **Version 2 only** | The total number of TCP packets received from destination since the last update. |
| 8143 | Bytes received **Version 2 only** | The total number of TCP packet bytes received from destination since the last update. Packet bytes include packet header and payload.|

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete **myResourceGroup** resource group and all of the resources it contains:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***myResourceGroup***. Select **myResourceGroup** from the search results.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. In **Delete a resource group**, enter ***myResourceGroup***, and then select **Delete**.

1. Select **Delete** to confirm the deletion of the resource group and all its resources.

> [!NOTE]
> The **myVM-nsg-myResourceGroup-flowlog** flow log is in the **NetworkWatcherRG** resource group, but it'll be deleted after deleting the **myVM-nsg** network security group (by deleting the **myResourceGroup** resource group).
