# Introduction to Azure Defender for App Service

Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building and hosting your web apps and APIs without worrying about having to manage the infrastructure. It provides management, monitoring, and operational insights to meet enterprise-grade performance, security, and compliance requirements. For more information, see [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/).

**Azure Defender for App Service** uses the scale of the cloud to identify attacks targeting applications running over App Service. Attackers probe web applications to find and exploit weaknesses. Before being routed to specific environments, requests to applications running in Azure go through several gateways, where they're inspected and logged. This data is then used to identify exploits and attackers, and to learn new patterns that will be used later.

By using the visibility that Azure has as a cloud provider, Security Center analyzes App Service internal logs to identify attack methodology on multiple targets. For example, methodology includes widespread scanning and distributed attacks. This type of attack typically comes from a small subset of IPs, and shows patterns of crawling to similar endpoints on multiple hosts. The attacks are searching for a vulnerable page or plugin, and can't be identified from the standpoint of a single host.

## What does Azure Defender for App Service protect?

With the App Service plan enabled, Security Center assesses the resources covered by your App Service plan and generates security recommendations based on its findings. Security Center protects the VM instance in which your App Service is running and the management interface. It also monitors requests and responses sent to and from your apps running in App Service.

If you're running a Windows-based App Service plan, Security Center also has access to the underlying sandboxes and VMs. Together with the log data mentioned above, the infrastructure can tell the story, from a new attack circulating in the wild to compromises in customer machines. Therefore, even if Security Center is deployed after a web app has been exploited, it may be able to detect ongoing attacks.


## Protect your Azure App Service web apps and APIs
To protect your Azure App Service plan with Azure Defender for App Service:

- Ensure you have a supported App Service plan that is associated with dedicated machines. Supported plans are listed above in [Availability](#availability).

- Enable **Azure Defender** on your subscription (you can optionally enable only the **Azure Defender for App Service** plan) as described in [Pricing of Azure Security Center](security-center-pricing.md)

Security Center is natively integrated with App Service, eliminating the need for deployment and onboarding - the integration is transparent.

>[!NOTE]
> The pricing and settings page lists a number of instances for your **Resource Quantity**. This represents the total number of compute instances, in all App Service plans on this subscription, running at the moment when you opened the pricing tier page.
>
> Azure App Service offers a variety of plans. Your App Service plan defines the set of compute resources for a web app to run. These are equivalent to server farms in conventional web hosting. One or more apps can be configured to run on the same computing resources (or in the same App Service plan).
>
>To validate the count, head to ‘App Service plans’ in the Azure Portal, where you can see the number of compute instances used by each plan.
