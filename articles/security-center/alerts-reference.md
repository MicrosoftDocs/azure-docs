# Security alerts - a reference guide

This article lists the security alerts you might get from Azure Security Center and any Azure Defender plans you've enabled. The alerts shown in your environment depend on the resources and services you're protecting, as well as your customized configuration.

At the bottom of this page, there's a table describing the Azure Security Center kill chain aligned with version 7 of the [MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/).

[Learn how to respond to these alerts](security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md).

| **Detected suspicious use of Cacls to lower the security state of the system**     | Attackers use myriad ways like brute force, spear phishing etc. to achieve initial compromise and get a foothold on the network. Once initial compromise is achieved they often take steps to lower the security settings of a system. Cacls—short for change access control list is Microsoft Windows native command-line utility often used for modifying the security permission on folders and files. A lot of time the binary is used by the attackers to lower the security settings of a system. This is done by giving Everyone full access to some of the system binaries like ftp.exe, net.exe, wscript.exe etc. Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected suspicious use of Cacls to lower the security of a system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | -                                            | Medium        |

|Alert (alert type)|Description|MITRE tactics<br>([Learn more](#intentions))|Severity|
|----|----|:----:|--|
| **K8S API requests from proxy IP address detected**<br>(K8S_TI_Proxy)                 | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected API requests to your cluster from an IP address that is associated with proxy services, such as TOR. While this behavior can be legitimate, it's often seen in malicious activities, when attackers try to hide their source IP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Execution                                    | Low      |
| **Container with a sensitive volume mount detected**<br>(K8S_SensitiveMount)          | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new container with a sensitive volume mount. The volume that was detected is a hostPath type which mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount for gaining access to the node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Privilege Escalation                         | Medium   |
| **CoreDNS modification in Kubernetes detected**<br>(K8S_CoreDnsModification)          | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a modification of the CoreDNS configuration. The configuration of CoreDNS can be modified by overriding its configmap. While this activity can be legitimate, if attackers have permissions to modify the configmap, they can change the behavior of the cluster’s DNS server and poison it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Lateral Movement                             | Low      |
| **Creation of admission webhook configuration detected**<br>(K8S_AdmissionController) | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new admission webhook configuration. Kubernetes has two built-in generic admission controllers: MutatingAdmissionWebhook and ValidatingAdmissionWebhook. The behavior of these admission controllers is determined by an admission webhook that the user deploys to the cluster. The usage of such admission controllers can be legitimate, however attackers can use such webhooks for modifying the requests (in case of MutatingAdmissionWebhook) or inspecting the requests and gain sensitive information (in case of ValidatingAdmissionWebhook). | Credential Access, Persistence               | Low      |

| **A possible vulnerability to SQL Injection**<br>(SQL.VM_VulnerabilityToSqlInjection<br>SQL.DB_VulnerabilityToSqlInjection<br>SQL.MI_VulnerabilityToSqlInjection<br>SQL.DW_VulnerabilityToSqlInjection) | An application has generated a faulty SQL statement in the database. This can indicate a possible vulnerability to SQL injection attacks. There are two possible reasons for a faulty statement. A defect in application code might have constructed the faulty SQL statement. Or, application code or stored procedures didn't sanitize user input when constructing the faulty SQL statement, which can be exploited for SQL injection. | PreAttack                                    | Medium   |

Conficker was a computer worm that targets the Microsoft Windows operating system and was first detected in November 2008. Conficker infected millions of computers including government, business and home computers in over 200 countries/regions, making it the largest known computer worm infection since the 2003 Welchia worm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Command and Control                          | Medium   |
| **Possible incoming %{Service Name} brute force attempts detected**<br>(Generic_Incoming_BF_OneToOne) | Network traffic analysis detected incoming %{Service Name} communication to %{Victim IP}, associated with your resource %{Compromised Host} from %{Attacker IP}. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected incoming traffic has been forwarded to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows suspicious activity between %{Start Time} and %{End Time} on port %{Victim Port}. This activity is consistent with brute force attempts against %{Service Name} servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | PreAttack                                    | Medium   |

When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected incoming traffic has been forwarded to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows suspicious activity between %{Start Time} and %{End Time} on port %{Port Number} (%{SQL Service Type}). This activity is consistent with brute force attempts against SQL servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | PreAttack                                    | Medium   |
| **Possible outgoing denial-of-service attack detected**<br>(DDOS)                                     | Network traffic analysis detected anomalous outgoing activity originating from %{Compromised Host}, a resource in your deployment. This activity may indicate that your resource was compromised and is now engaged in denial-of-service attacks against external endpoints. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected activity might indicate that one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway) was compromised. Based on the volume of connections, we believe that the following IPs are possibly the targets of the DOS attack: %{Possible Victims}.  Note that it is possible that the communication to some of these IPs is legitimate.                                                                                                         | Impact                                       | Medium   |
| **Possible outgoing port scanning activity detected**<br>(PortSweeping)                               | Network traffic analysis detected suspicious outgoing traffic from %{Compromised Host}. This traffic may be a result of a port scanning activity. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected outgoing traffic has been originated from to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). If this behavior is intentional, please note that performing port scanning is against Azure Terms of service. If this behavior is unintentional, it may mean your resource has been compromised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Discovery                                    | Medium   |
| **Suspicious incoming RDP network activity from multiple sources**<br>(RDP_Incoming_BF_ManyToOne)     | Network traffic analysis detected anomalous incoming Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) communication to %{Victim IP}, associated with your resource %{Compromised Host}, from multiple sources. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected incoming traffic has been forwarded to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows %{Number of Attacking IPs} unique IPs connecting to your resource, which is considered abnormal for this environment. This activity may indicate an attempt to brute force your RDP end point from multiple hosts (Botnet)                                                                                                                                                        | PreAttack                                    | Medium   |

Specifically, sampled network data shows %{Number of Attacking IPs} unique IPs connecting to your resource, which is considered abnormal for this environment. This activity may indicate an attempt to brute force your SSH end point from multiple hosts (Botnet)                                                                                                                                                                                  | PreAttack                                    | Medium   |
| **Suspicious incoming SSH network activity**<br>(SSH_Incoming_BF_OneToOne)                            | Network traffic analysis detected anomalous incoming SSH communication to %{Victim IP}, associated with your resource %{Compromised Host}, from %{Attacker IP}. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected incoming traffic has been forwarded to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows %{Number of Connections} incoming connections to your resource, which is considered abnormal for this environment.

| **Access from a suspicious IP address to a key vault**<br>(KV_SuspiciousIPAccess)  | A key vault has been successfully accessed by an IP that has been identified by Microsoft Threat Intelligence as a suspicious IP address. This may indicate that your infrastructure has been compromised. We recommend further investigation. Learn more about [Microsoft's threat intelligence capabilities](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684).                                                                                                                                                                                                | Credential Access                            | Medium   |
| **Access from a TOR exit node to a key vault**<br>(KV_TORAccess)                   | A key vault has been accessed from a known TOR exit node. This could be an indication that a threat actor has accessed the key vault and is using the TOR network to hide their source location. We recommend further investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Credential Access                            | Medium   |
| **High volume of operations in a key vault**<br>(KV_OperationVolumeAnomaly)        | An anomalous number of key vault operations were performed by a user, service principal, and/or a specific key vault. This anomalous activity pattern may be legitimate, but it could be an indication that a threat actor has gained access to the key vault and the secrets contained within it. We recommend further investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Credential Access                            | Medium   |
| **Suspicious policy change and secret query in a key vault**<br>(KV_PutGetAnomaly) | A user or service principal has performed an anomalous Vault Put policy change operation followed by one or more Secret Get operations. This pattern is not normally performed by the specified user or service principal. This may be legitimate activity, but it could be an indication that a threat actor  has updated the key vault policy to access previously inaccessible secrets. We recommend further investigations.                                                                                                                                 | Credential Access                            | Medium   |
| **Suspicious secret listing and query in a key vault**<br>(KV_ListGetAnomaly)      | A user or service principal has performed an anomalous Secret List operation followed by one or more Secret Get operations. This pattern is not normally performed by the specified user or service principal and is typically associated with secret dumping. This may be legitimate activity, but it could be an indication that a threat actor  has gained access to the key vault and is trying to discover secrets that can be used to move laterally through your network and/or gain access to sensitive resources. We recommend further investigations. | Credential Access                            | Medium   |
| **Unusual application accessed a key vault**<br>(KV_AppAnomaly)                    | A key vault has been accessed by a service principal that does not normally access it. This anomalous access pattern may be legitimate activity, but it could be an indication that a threat actor  has gained access to the key vault in an attempt to access the secrets contained within it. We recommend further investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Credential Access                            | Medium   |
| **Unusual operation pattern in a key vault**<br>KV_OperationPatternAnomaly)        | An anomalous pattern of key vault operations was performed by a user, service principal, and/or a specific key vault. This anomalous activity pattern may be legitimate, but it could be an indication that a threat actor has gained access to the key vault and the secrets contained within it. We recommend further investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Credential Access                            | Medium   |
| **Unusual user accessed a key vault**<br>(KV_UserAnomaly)                          | A key vault has been accessed by a user that does not normally access it. This anomalous access pattern may be legitimate activity, but it could be an indication that a threat actor  has gained access to the key vault in an attempt to access the secrets contained within it. We recommend further investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Credential Access                            | Medium   |
| **Unusual user-application pair accessed a key vault**<br>(KV_UserAppAnomaly)      | A key vault has been accessed by a user-service principal pair that does not normally access it. This anomalous access pattern may be legitimate activity, but it could be an indication that a threat actor  has gained access to the key vault in an attempt to access the secrets contained within it. We recommend further investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Credential Access                            | Medium   |
| **User accessed high volume of key vaults**<br>(KV_AccountVolumeAnomaly)           | A user or service principal has accessed an anomalously high volume of key vaults. This anomalous access pattern may be legitimate activity, but it could be an indication that a threat actor  has gained access to multiple key vaults in an attempt to access the secrets contained within them.

## MITRE ATT&CK tactics <a name="intentions"></a>

Understanding the intention of an attack can help you investigate and report the event more easily. To help with these efforts, Azure Security Center alerts include the MITRE tactics with many alerts.

The series of steps that describe the progression of a cyberattack from reconnaissance to data exfiltration is often referred to as a "kill chain". 

Security Center's supported kill chain intents are based on [version 7 of the MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/) and described in the table below.

| Tactic                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PreAttack**            | PreAttack could be either an attempt to access a certain resource regardless of a malicious intent, or a failed attempt to gain access to a target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is usually detected as an attempt, originating from outside the network, to scan the target system and identify an entry point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Initial Access**       | Initial Access is the stage where an attacker manages to get a foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is relevant for compute hosts and resources such as user accounts, certificates etc. Threat actors will often be able to control the resource after this stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Persistence**          | Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a system that gives a threat actor a persistent presence on that system. Threat actors will often need to maintain access to systems through interruptions such as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures that would require a remote access tool to restart or provide an alternate backdoor for them to regain access.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Privilege escalation is the result of actions that allow an adversary to obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or network. Certain tools or actions require a higher level of privilege to work and are likely necessary at many points throughout an operation. User accounts with permissions to access specific systems or perform specific functions necessary for adversaries to achieve their objective may also be considered an escalation of privilege.                                                                                                                        |
| **Defense Evasion**      | Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are the same as (or variations of) techniques in other categories that have the added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Credential Access**    | Credential access represents techniques resulting in access to or control over system, domain, or service credentials that are used within an enterprise environment. Adversaries will likely attempt to obtain legitimate credentials from users or administrator accounts (local system administrator or domain users with administrator access) to use within the network. With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create accounts for later use within the environment.                                                                                                      |
| **Discovery**            | Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides many native tools that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase.                                                                                                                                    |
| **LateralMovement**      | Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The lateral movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information from a system without needing additional tools, such as a remote access tool. An adversary can use lateral movement for many purposes, including remote Execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, access to specific information or files, access to additional credentials, or to cause an effect. |
| **Execution**            | The execution tactic represents techniques that result in execution of adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system. This tactic is often used in conjunction with lateral movement to expand access to remote systems on a network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Collection**           | Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Exfiltration**         | Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the adversary removing files and information from a target network. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Command and Control**  | The command and control tactic represents how adversaries communicate with systems under their control within a target network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Impact**               | Impact events primarily try to directly reduce the availability or integrity of a system, service, or network; including manipulation of data to impact a business or operational process. This would often refer to techniques such as ransomware, defacement, data manipulation, and others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
