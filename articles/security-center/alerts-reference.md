|**A logon from a malicious IP has been detected. [seen multiple times]**|A successful remote authentication for the account [account] and process [process] occurred, however the logon IP address (x.x.x.x) has previously been reported as malicious or highly unusual. A successful attack has probably occurred. Files with the .scr extensions are screen saver files and are normally reside and execute from the Windows system directory.|-|High|
|**Addition of Guest account to Local Administrators group**|Analysis of host data has detected the addition of the built-in Guest account to the Local Administrators group on %{Compromised Host}, which is strongly associated with attacker activity.|-|Medium|
|**An event log was cleared**|Machine logs indicate a suspicious event log clearing operation by user: '%{user name}' in Machine: '%{CompromisedEntity}'. The %{log channel} log was cleared.|-|Informational|
|**Antimalware Action Taken**|Microsoft Antimalware for Azure has taken an action to protect this machine from malware or other potentially unwanted software.|-|Medium|
|**Antimalware Action Failed**|Microsoft Antimalware has encountered an error when taking an action on malware or other potentially unwanted software.|-|Medium|
|**Detected Petya ransomware indicators**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected indicators associated with Petya ransomware. See https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/27/new-ransomware-old-techniques-petya-adds-worm-capabilities/ for more information. Review the command line associated in this alert and escalate this alert to your security team.|-|High|
|**Detected actions indicative of disabling and deleting IIS log files**|Analysis of host data detected actions that show IIS log files being disabled and/or deleted.|-|Medium|
|**Detected anomalous mix of upper and lower case characters in command-line**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a command line with anomalous mix of upper and lower case characters. This kind of pattern, while possibly benign, is also typical of attackers trying to hide from case-sensitive or hash-based rule matching when performing administrative tasks on a compromised host.|-|Medium|
|**Detected change to a registry key that can be abused to bypass UAC**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected that a registry key that can be abused to bypass UAC (User Account Control) was changed. This kind of configuration, while possibly benign, is also typical of attacker activity when trying to move from unprivileged (standard user) to privileged (for example administrator) access on a compromised host.|-|Medium|
|**Detected decoding of an executable using built-in certutil.exe tool**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected that certutil.exe, a built-in administrator utility, was being used to decode an executable instead of its mainstream purpose that relates to manipulating certificates and certificate data. Attackers are known to abuse functionality of legitimate administrator tools to perform malicious actions, for example using a tool such as certutil.exe to decode a malicious executable that will then be subsequently executed.|-|High|
|**Detected enabling of the WDigest UseLogonCredential registry key**|Analysis of host data detected a change in the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest\ "UseLogonCredential". Specifically this key has been updated to allow logon credentials to be stored in clear text in LSA memory. Once enabled an attacker can dump clear text passwords from LSA memory with credential harvesting tools such as Mimikatz.|-|Medium|
|**Detected encoded executable in command line data**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a base-64 encoded executable. This has previously been associated with attackers attempting to construct executables on-the-fly through a sequence of commands, and attempting to evade intrusion detection systems by ensuring that no individual command would trigger an alert. This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised host.|-|High|
|**Detected obfuscated command line**|Attackers use increasingly complex obfuscation techniques to evade detections that run against the underlying data. Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected suspicious indicators of obfuscation on the commandline.|-|Informational|
|**Detected possible execution of keygen executable**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected execution of a process whose name is indicative of a keygen tool; such tools are typically used to defeat software licensing mechanisms but their download is often bundled with other malicious software.

Attackers are known to abuse this service to transfer malicious binaries to any other computer, phone, or tablet.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suppression of legal notice displayed to users at logon**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected changes to the registry key that controls whether a legal notice is displayed to users when they log on. Microsoft security analysis has determined that this is a common activity undertaken by attackers after having compromised a host.|-|Low|
|**Detected suspicious combination of HTA and PowerShell**|mshta.exe (Microsoft HTML Application Host) which is a signed Microsoft binary is being used by the attackers to launch malicious PowerShell commands. Attackers often resort to having an HTA file with inline VBScript. When a victim browses to the HTA file and chooses to run it, the PowerShell commands and scripts that it contains are executed. Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected mshta.exe launching PowerShell commands.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious commandline arguments**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected suspicious commandline arguments that have been used in conjunction with a reverse shell used by activity group HYDROGEN.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious commandline used to start all executables in a directory**|Analysis of host data has detected a suspicious process running on %{Compromised Host}. The commandline indicates an attempt to start all executables (*.exe) that may reside in a directory. This could be an indication of a compromised host.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious credentials in commandline**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a suspicious password being used to execute a file by activity group BORON. This activity group has been known to use this password to execute Pirpi malware on a victim host.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious document credentials**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a suspicious, common precomputed password hash used by malware being used to execute a file. Activity group HYDROGEN has been known to use this password to execute malware on a victim host.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious execution of VBScript.Encode command**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected the execution of VBScript.Encode command. This encodes the scripts into unreadable text, making it more difficult for users to examine the code. Microsoft threat research shows that attackers often use encoded VBscript files as part of their attack to evade detection systems. This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised host.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious execution via rundll32.exe**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected rundll32.exe being used to execute a process with an uncommon name, consistent with the process naming scheme previously seen used by activity group GOLD when installing their first stage implant on a compromised host.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious file cleanup commands**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a combination of systeminfo commands that has previously been associated with one of activity group GOLD's methods of performing post-compromise self-cleanup activity. While 'systeminfo.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool, executing it twice in succession, followed by a delete command in the way that has occurred here is rare.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious file creation**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected creation or execution of a process which has previously indicated post-compromise action taken on a victim host by activity group BARIUM. This activity group has been known to use this technique to download additional malware to a compromised host after an attachment in a phishing doc has been opened.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious named pipe communications**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected data being written to a local named pipe from a Windows console command. Named pipes are known to be a channel used by attackers to task and communicate with a malicious implant. This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised host.|-|High|
|**Detected suspicious network activity**|Analysis of network traffic from %{Compromised Host} detected suspicious network activity. Such traffic, while possibly benign, is typically used by an attacker to communicate with malicious servers for downloading of tools, command-and-control and exfiltration of data. Typical related attacker activity includes copying remote administration tools to a compromised host and exfiltrating user data from it.|-|Low|
|**Detected suspicious new firewall rule**|Analysis of host data detected a new firewall rule has been added via netsh.exe to allow traffic from an executable in a suspicious location.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious use of Cacls to lower the security state of the system**|Attackers use myriad ways like brute force, spear phishing etc. to achieve initial compromise and get a foothold on the network. Once initial compromise is achieved they often take steps to lower the security settings of a system. Cacls—short for change access control list is Microsoft Windows native command-line utility often used for modifying the security permission on folders and files. A lot of time the binary is used by the attackers to lower the security settings of a system. This is done by giving Everyone full access to some of the system binaries like ftp.exe, net.exe, wscript.exe etc. Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected suspicious use of Cacls to lower the security of a system.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious use of FTP -s Switch**|Analysis of process creation data from the %{Compromised Host} detected the use of the FTP "-s:filename" switch. This switch is used to specify an FTP script file for the client to run. Malware or malicious processes are known to use this FTP switch (-s:filename) to point to a script file which is configured to connect to a remote FTP server and download additional malicious binaries.|-|Medium|
|**Detected suspicious use of Pcalua.exe to launch executable code**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected the use of pcalua.exe to launch executable code. Pcalua.exe is component of the Microsoft Windows "Program Compatibility Assistant" which detects compatibility issues during the installation or execution of a program. Attackers are known to abuse functionality of legitimate Windows system tools to perform malicious actions, for example using pcalua.exe with the -a switch to launch malicious executables either locally or from remote shares.|-|Medium|
|**Detected the disabling of critical services**|The analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected execution of "net.exe stop" command being used to stop critical services like SharedAccess or Windows Security Center. The stopping of either of these services can be indication of a malicious behavior.|-|Medium|

This could be legitimate activity, or an indication that one of your machines has been compromised.|-|Medium|
|**Executable found running from a suspicious location**|Analysis of host data detected an executable file on %{Compromised Host} that is running from a location in common with known suspicious files. This executable could either be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised host.|-|High|
|**Fileless attack technique detected**|The memory of the process specified below contains evidence of a fileless attack technique. Fileless attacks are used by attackers to execute code while evading detection by security software. Specific behaviors include:<br>1) Shellcode, which is a small piece of code typically used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability.<br>2) Executable image injected into the process, such as in a code injection attack.<br>3) Active network connections. See NetworkConnections below for details.<br>4) Function calls to security sensitive operating system interfaces. See Capabilities below for referenced OS capabilities.<br>5) Process hollowing, which is a technique used by malware in which a legitimate process is loaded on the system to act as a container for hostile code.<br>6) Contains a thread that was started in a dynamically allocated code segment. This is a common pattern for process injection attacks.|DefenseEvasion / Execution|High|
|**Fileless attack behavior detected**|The memory of the process specified contains behaviors commonly used by fileless attacks.

This behavior was seen [x] times today on the following machines: [Machine names]|-|High|
|**Multiple Domain Accounts Queried**|Analysis of host data has determined that an unusual number of distinct domain accounts are being queried within a short time period from %{Compromised Host}. This kind of activity could be legitimate, but can also be an indication of compromise.|-|Medium|
|**Possible credential dumping detected [seen multiple times]**|Analysis of host data has detected use of native windows tool (e.g. sqldumper.exe) being used in a way that allows to extract credentials from memory. Attackers often use these techniques to extract credentials that they then further use for lateral movement and privilege escalation. This behavior was seen [x] times today on the following machines: [Machine names]|-|Medium|
|**Potential attempt to bypass AppLocker detected**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected a potential attempt to bypass AppLocker restrictions. AppLocker can be configured to implement a policy that limits what executables are allowed to run on a Windows system. The command-line pattern similar to that identified in this alert has been previously associated with attacker attempts to circumvent AppLocker policy by using trusted executables (allowed by AppLocker policy) to execute untrusted code. This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised host.|-|High|
|**PsExec execution detected**|Analysis of host data indicates that the process %{Process Name} was executed by PsExec utility. PsExec can be used for running processes remotely. This technique might be used for malicious purposes.|-|Informational|
|**Ransomware indicators detected [seen multiple times]**|Analysis of host data indicates suspicious activity traditionally associated with lock-screen and encryption ransomware. Lock screen ransomware displays a full-screen message preventing interactive use of the host and access to its files. Encryption ransomware prevents access by encrypting data files. In both cases a ransom message is typically displayed, requesting payment in order to restore file access. This behavior was seen [x] times today on the following machines: [Machine names]|-|High|
|**Ransomware indicators detected**|Analysis of host data indicates suspicious activity traditionally associated with lock-screen and encryption ransomware.

In both cases a ransom message is typically displayed, requesting payment in order to restore file access.|-|High|
|**Rare SVCHOST service group executed**|The system process SVCHOST was observed running a rare service group. Malware often uses SVCHOST to masquerade its malicious activity.|-|Informational|
|**Sticky keys attack detected**|Analysis of host data indicates that an attacker may be subverting an accessibility binary (for example sticky keys, onscreen keyboard, narrator) in order to provide backdoor access to the host %{Compromised Host}.|-|Medium|
|**Successful brute force attack**|Several sign in attempts were detected from the same source. Some successfully authenticated to the host.<br>This resembles a burst attack, in which an attacker performs numerous authentication attempts to find valid account credentials.|-|Medium/High|
|**Suspect integrity level indicative of RDP hijacking**|Analysis of host data has detected the tscon.exe running with SYSTEM privileges - this can be indicative of an attacker abusing this binary in order to switch context to any other logged on user on this host; it is a known attacker technique to compromise additional user accounts and move laterally across a network.|-|Medium|
|**Suspect service installation**|Analysis of host data has detected the installation of tscon.exe as a service: this binary being started as a service potentially allows an attacker to trivially switch to any other logged on user on this host by hijacking RDP connections; it is a known attacker technique to compromise additional user accounts and move laterally across a network.|-|Medium|
|**Suspected Kerberos Golden Ticket attack parameters observed**|Analysis of host data detected commandline parameters consistent with a Kerberos Golden Ticket attack.|-|Medium|
|**Suspicious Account Creation Detected**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected creation or use of a local account %{Suspicious account name} : this account name closely resembles a standard Windows account or group name '%{Similar To Account Name}'. This is potentially a rogue account created by an attacker, so named in order to avoid being noticed by a human administrator.|-|Medium|
|**Suspicious Activity Detected**|Analysis of host data has detected a sequence of one or more processes running on %{machine name} that have historically been associated with malicious activity. While individual commands may appear benign the alert is scored based on an aggregation of these commands. This could either be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised host.|-|Medium|

|**Suspicious Volume Shadow Copy Activity**|Analysis of host data has detected a shadow copy deletion activity on the resource. Volume Shadow Copy (VSC) is an important artifact that stores data snapshots. Some malware and specifically Ransomware, targets VSC to sabotage backup strategies.|-|High|
|**Suspicious WindowPosition registry value detected**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected an attempted WindowPosition registry configuration change that could be indicative of hiding application windows in non-visible sections of the desktop. This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised machine: this type of activity has been previously associated with known adware (or unwanted software) such as Win32/OneSystemCare and Win32/SystemHealer and malware such as Win32/Creprote. When the WindowPosition value is set to 201329664, (Hex: 0x0c00 0c00, corresponding to X-axis=0c00 and the Y-axis=0c00) this places the console app's window in a non-visible section of the user's screen in an area that is hidden from view below the visible start menu/taskbar. Known suspect Hex value includes, but not limited to c000c000|-|Low|
|**Suspicious authentication activity**|Although none of them succeeded, some of them used accounts were recognized by the host. This resembles a dictionary attack, in which an attacker performs numerous authentication attempts using a dictionary of predefined account names and passwords in order to find valid credentials to access the host. This indicates that some of your host account names might exist in a well-known account name dictionary.|-|Medium|
|**Suspicious code segment detected**|Indicates that a code segment has been allocated by using non-standard methods, such as reflective injection and process hollowing. The alert provides additional characteristics of the code segment that have been processed to provide context for the capabilities and behaviors of the reported code segment.|-|Medium|
|**Suspicious command execution**|Machine logs indicate a suspicious command-line execution by user %{user name}.|-||
|**Suspicious double extension file executed**|Analysis of host data indicates an execution of a process with a suspicious double extension. This extension may trick users into thinking files are safe to be opened and might indicate the presence of malware on the system.|-|High|
|**Suspicious download using Certutil detected [seen multiple times]**|Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected the use of certutil.exe, a built-in administrator utility, for the download of a binary instead of its mainstream purpose that relates to manipulating certificates and certificate data.

| **Container with a sensitive volume mount detected**    | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new container with a sensitive volume mount. The volume that was detected is a hostPath type that mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount to gain access to the node.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | PrivilegeEscalation                   | Medium   |
| **Digital currency mining container detected**          | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a container that has an image associated with a digital currency mining tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Execution                             | High     |
| **Exposed Kubernetes dashboard detected**               | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected exposure of the Kubernetes Dashboard by a LoadBalancer service. Exposed dashboards allow unauthenticated access to the cluster management and pose a security threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Initial access                        | High     |
| **New container in the kube-system namespace detected** | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new container in the kube-system namespace that isn't among the containers that normally run in this namespace. The kube-system namespaces shouldn't contain user resources. Attackers can use this namespace to hide malicious components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Persistence                           | Low      |
| **New high privileges role detected**                   | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new role with high privileges. A binding to a role with high privileges gives the user/group elevated privileges in the cluster. Unnecessarily providing elevated privileges might result in privilege escalation issues in the cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Persistence                           | Low      |
| **Privileged container detected**                       | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new privileged container. A privileged container has access to the node's resources and breaks the isolation between containers. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | PrivilegeEscalation                   | Low      |
| **Role binding to the cluster-admin role detected**     | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new binding to the cluster-admin role resulting in administrator privileges. Unnecessarily providing administrator privileges might result in privilege escalation issues in the cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Persistence                           | Low      |
| **Exposed Kubeflow dashboard detected**                 | The Kubernetes audit log analysis detected exposure of the Istio Ingress by a load balancer in a cluster that runs Kubeflow.<br>This action might expose the Kubeflow dashboard to the internet. If the dashboard is exposed to the internet, attackers can access it and run malicious containers or code on the cluster.<br>Learn more in [Misconfigured Kubeflow workloads are a security risk.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/10/misconfigured-kubeflow-workloads-are-a-security-risk) | Initial access                        | Medium   |
| **Exposed Redis service in AKS detected**               | The Kubernetes audit log analysis detected exposure of a Redis service by a load balancer.<br>If the service doesn’t require authentication, exposing it to the internet poses a security risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Initial access                        | Medium   |
| **Exposed Kubernetes service detected**                 | The Kubernetes audit log analysis detected exposure of a service by a load balancer. This service is related to a sensitive application that allows high impact operations in the cluster such as running processes on the node or creating new containers.<br>In some cases, this service doesn’t require authentication. If the service doesn’t require authentication, exposing it to the internet poses a security risk.                                                                                 | Initial access                        | Medium   |

|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------:|----------|
| **Privileged Container Detected**                  | Machine logs indicate that a privileged Docker container is running. A privileged container has full access to the host's resources. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the host machine.                                                                      | PrivilegeEscalation / Execution    | Low      |
| **Privileged command run in container**            | Machine logs indicate that a privileged command was run in a Docker container. A privileged command has extended privileges on the host machine.                                                                                                                                                           | PrivilegeEscalation                | Low      |
| **Exposed Docker daemon detected**                 | Machine logs indicate that your Docker daemon (dockerd) exposes a TCP socket. By default, Docker configuration doesn't use encryption or authentication when a TCP socket is enabled. Anyone with access to the relevant port can then get full access to the Docker daemon.                               | Exploitation / Execution           | Medium   |
| **SSH server is running inside a container**       | Machine logs indicate that an SSH server is running inside a Docker container. While this behavior can be intentional, it frequently indicates that a container is misconfigured or breached.                                                                                                              | Execution                          | Medium   |
| **Container with a miner image detected**          | Machine logs indicate execution of a Docker container running an image associated with digital currency mining. This behavior can possibly indicate that your resources are being abused.                                                                                                                  | Execution                          | High     |
| **Suspicious request to Kubernetes API**           | Machine logs indicate that a suspicious request was made to the Kubernetes API. The request was sent from a Kubernetes node, possibly from one of the containers running in the node. Although this behavior can be intentional, it might indicate that the node is running a compromised container.       | Execution                          | Medium   |
| **Suspicious request to the Kubernetes Dashboard** | Machine logs indicate that a suspicious request was made to the Kubernetes Dashboard.

| **A possible vulnerability to SQL Injection**   | An application has generated a faulty SQL statement in the database. This can indicate a possible vulnerability to SQL injection attacks. There are two possible reasons for a faulty statement. A defect in application code might have constructed the faulty SQL statement. Or, application code or stored procedures didn't sanitize user input when constructing the faulty SQL statement, which can be exploited for SQL injection.   | -                                  | Medium   |

| **Log on from an unusual Azure Data Center**    | There has been a change in the access pattern to an SQL Server, where someone has signed in to the server from an unusual Azure Data Center. In some cases, the alert detects a legitimate action (a new application or Azure service). In other cases, the alert detects a malicious action (attacker operating from breached resource in Azure).                                                                                          | Probing                            | Low      |
| **Log on from an unusual location**             | There has been a change in the access pattern to SQL Server, where someone has signed in to the server from an unusual geographical location. In some cases, the alert detects a legitimate action (a new application or developer maintenance). In other cases, the alert detects a malicious action (a former employee or external attacker).                                                                                             | Exploitation                       | Medium   |

| **Possible compromised machine detected**                             | Threat intelligence indicates that your machine (at IP %{Machine IP}) may have been compromised by a malware of type Conficker. Conficker was a computer worm that targets the Microsoft Windows operating system and was first detected in November 2008. Conficker infected millions of computers including government, business and home computers in over 200 countries/regions, making it the largest known computer worm infection since the 2003 Welchia worm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | -                                  | Medium   |
| **Possible incoming %{Service Name} brute force attempts detected**   | Network traffic analysis detected incoming %{Service Name} communication to %{Victim IP}, associated with your resource %{Compromised Host} from %{Attacker IP}. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected incoming traffic has been forwarded to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows suspicious activity between %{Start Time} and %{End Time} on port %{Victim Port}. This activity is consistent with brute force attempts against %{Service Name} servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | -                                  | Medium   |
| **Possible incoming SQL brute force attempts detected**               | Network traffic analysis detected incoming SQL communication to %{Victim IP}, associated with your resource %{Compromised Host}, from %{Attacker IP}. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected incoming traffic has been forwarded to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows suspicious activity between %{Start Time} and %{End Time} on port %{Port Number} (%{SQL Service Type}). This activity is consistent with brute force attempts against SQL servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | -                                  | Medium   |
| **Possible outgoing denial-of-service attack detected**               | Network traffic analysis detected anomalous outgoing activity originating from %{Compromised Host}, a resource in your deployment. This activity may indicate that your resource was compromised and is now engaged in denial-of-service attacks against external endpoints. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected activity might indicate that one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway) was compromised. Based on the volume of connections, we believe that the following IPs are possibly the targets of the DOS attack: %{Possible Victims}.  Note that it is possible that the communication to some of these IPs is legitimate.                                                                                                         | -                                  | Medium   |
| **Possible outgoing port scanning activity detected**                 | Network traffic analysis detected suspicious outgoing traffic from %{Compromised Host}. This traffic may be a result of a port scanning activity. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected outgoing traffic has been originated from to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). If this behavior is intentional, please note that performing port scanning is against Azure Terms of service. If this behavior is unintentional, it may mean your resource has been compromised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | -                                  | Medium   |
| **Suspicious incoming RDP network activity from multiple sources**    | Network traffic analysis detected anomalous incoming Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) communication to %{Victim IP}, associated with your resource %{Compromised Host}, from multiple sources. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected incoming traffic has been forwarded to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows %{Number of Attacking IPs} unique IPs connecting to your resource, which is considered abnormal for this environment. This activity may indicate an attempt to brute force your RDP end point from multiple hosts (Botnet)                                                                                                                                                        | -                                  | Medium   |

This behavior may indicate that your resource is taking part in %{Attacked Protocol} brute force attempts or port sweeping attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | -                                  | Medium   |
| **Suspicious outgoing RDP network activity to multiple destinations** | Network traffic analysis detected anomalous outgoing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) communication to multiple destinations originating from %{Compromised Host} (%{Attacker IP}), a resource in your deployment. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected outgoing traffic has been originated from to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). Specifically, sampled network data shows your machine connecting to %{Number of Attacked IPs} unique IPs, which is considered abnormal for this environment. This activity may indicate that your resource was compromised and is now used to brute force external RDP end points. Note that this type of activity could possibly cause your IP to be flagged as malicious by external entities. | -                                  | High     |

| **PREVIEW - Activity from anonymous IP addresses**                                       | Users activity from an IP address that has been identified as an anonymous proxy IP address has been detected.<br>These proxies are used by people who want to hide their device's IP address, and can be used for malicious intent. This detection uses a machine learning algorithm that reduces false positives, such as mis-tagged IP addresses that are widely used by users in the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | -                                  | Medium   |

The anomaly detection engine stores information about previous locations used by users in the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | -                                  | Medium   |
| **PREVIEW - Impossible travel activity**                                                 | Two user activities (in a single or multiple sessions) have occurred, originating from geographically distant locations. This occurs within a time period shorter than the time it would have taken the user to travel from the first location to the second. This indicates that a different user is using the same credentials.<br>This detection uses a machine learning algorithm that ignores obvious false positives contributing to the impossible travel conditions, such as VPNs and locations regularly used by other users in the organization. The detection has an initial learning period of seven days, during which it learns a new user's activity pattern. | -                                  | Medium   |

| **Access from a TOR exit node to a key vault**<br>KV_TORAccess                   | A key vault has been accessed from a known TOR exit node. This could be an indication that a threat actor has accessed the key vault and is using the TOR network to hide their source location. We recommend further investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | CredentialAccess                      | Medium   |
| **High volume of operations in a key vault**<br>KV_OperationVolumeAnomaly        | An anomalous number of key vault operations were performed by a user, service principal, and/or a specific key vault. This anomalous activity pattern may be legitimate, but it could be an indication that a threat actor has gained access to the key vault and the secrets contained within it. We recommend further investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | CredentialAccess                      | Medium   |
| **Suspicious policy change and secret query in a key vault**<br>KV_PutGetAnomaly | A user or service principal has performed an anomalous Vault Put policy change operation followed by one or more Secret Get operations. This pattern is not normally performed by the specified user or service principal. This may be legitimate activity, but it could be an indication that a threat actor  has updated the key vault policy to access previously inaccessible secrets.

## Intentions

Understanding the intention of an attack can help you investigate and report the event more easily. Azure Security Center alerts include the 'intent' field to help with these efforts.

The series of steps that describe the progression of a cyberattack from reconnaissance to data exfiltration is often referred to as a "kill chain". 

Security Center's supported kill chain intents are based on the [MITRE ATT&CK&trade; framework](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise) and described in the table below.

| Intent                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PreAttack**           | PreAttack could be either an attempt to access a certain resource regardless of a malicious intent, or a failed attempt to gain access to a target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is usually detected as an attempt, originating from outside the network, to scan the target system and identify an entry point. </br>Further details on the PreAttack stage can be read in [MITRE's page](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/pre/).                                                                                                                                |
| **InitialAccess**       | InitialAccess is the stage where an attacker manages to get a foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is relevant for compute hosts and resources such as user accounts, certificates etc. Threat actors will often be able to control the resource after this stage. |
| **Persistence**         | Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a system that gives a threat actor a persistent presence on that system. Threat actors will often need to maintain access to systems through interruptions such as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures that would require a remote access tool to restart or provide an alternate backdoor for them to regain access.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **PrivilegeEscalation** | Privilege escalation is the result of actions that allow an adversary to obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or network. Certain tools or actions require a higher level of privilege to work and are likely necessary at many points throughout an operation. User accounts with permissions to access specific systems or perform specific functions necessary for adversaries to achieve their objective may also be considered an escalation of privilege.                                                                                                                        |
| **DefenseEvasion**      | Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are the same as (or variations of) techniques in other categories that have the added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **CredentialAccess**    | Credential access represents techniques resulting in access to or control over system, domain, or service credentials that are used within an enterprise environment. Adversaries will likely attempt to obtain legitimate credentials from users or administrator accounts (local system administrator or domain users with administrator access) to use within the network. With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create accounts for later use within the environment.                                                                                                      |
| **Discovery**           | Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides many native tools that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase.                                                                                                                                    |
| **LateralMovement**     | Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The lateral movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information from a system without needing additional tools, such as a remote access tool. An adversary can use lateral movement for many purposes, including remote Execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, access to specific information or files, access to additional credentials, or to cause an effect. |
| **Execution**           | The execution tactic represents techniques that result in execution of adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system. This tactic is often used in conjunction with lateral movement to expand access to remote systems on a network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Collection**          | Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Exfiltration**        | Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the adversary removing files and information from a target network. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **CommandAndControl**   | The command and control tactic represents how adversaries communicate with systems under their control within a target network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Impact**              | Impact events primarily try to directly reduce the availability or integrity of a system, service, or network; including manipulation of data to impact a business or operational process. This would often refer to techniques such as ransomware, defacement, data manipulation, and others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |
