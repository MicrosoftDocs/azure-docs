# Security alerts - a reference guide

This article lists the security alerts you might see in Azure Security Center's Threat Protection module. The alerts shown in your environment depend on the resources and services you're protecting, as well as your customized configuration.

To learn about how to respond to these alerts, see [Manage and respond to security alerts in Azure Security Center](security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md).

To learn about how to export alerts (and recommendations) see [Export security alerts and recommendations (Preview)](continuous-export.md).

Below the alerts table is a table describing the Azure Security Center kill chain that is used to categorize the intents of these alerts. 

## Azure Security Center alerts

|Alert|Description|Intent ([Learn more](#intentions))|
|----|----|:----:|
||<a name="alerts-windows"></a><h3>Windows machines</h3> [Further details and notes](security-center-alerts-iaas.md#windows-)||
|**Code injection discovered**|Code injection is the insertion of executable modules into running processes or threads. This technique is used by malware to access data, while successfully hiding itself to prevent being found and removed.<br>This alert indicates that an injected module is present in the crash dump. To differentiate between malicious and non-malicious injected modules, Security Center checks whether the injected module conforms to a profile of suspicious behavior.|-|
|**Suspicious code segment detected**|Indicates that a code segment has been allocated by using non-standard methods, such as reflective injection and process hollowing. The alert provides additional characteristics of the code segment that have been processed to provide context for the capabilities and behaviors of the reported code segment.|-|
|**Shellcode discovered**|Shellcode is the payload that is run after malware exploits a software vulnerability.<br>This alert indicates that crash dump analysis has detected executable code that exhibits behavior commonly performed by malicious payloads. Although non-malicious software can also perform this behavior, it isn't typical of normal software development practices.|-|
|**Fileless attack technique detected**|The memory of the process specified contains a fileless attack toolkit: Meterpreter. Fileless attack toolkits typically don't have a presence on the file system, making detection by traditional antivirus software difficult.|DefenseEvasion / Execution|
||<a name="alerts-linux"></a><h3>Linux machines</h3> [Further details and notes](security-center-alerts-iaas.md#linux-)||
|**Process seen accessing the SSH authorized keys file in an unusual way**|An SSH authorized keys file has been accessed in a method similar to known malware campaigns. This access can indicate that an attacker is attempting to gain persistent access to a machine.|-|
|**Detected Persistence Attempt**|Host data analysis has detected that a startup script for single-user mode has been installed.<br>Because it's rare that any legitimate process would be required to run in that mode, this might indicate that an attacker has added a malicious process to every run-level to guarantee persistence. |Persistence|
|**Manipulation of scheduled tasks detected**|Host data analysis has detected possible manipulation of scheduled tasks. Attackers often add scheduled tasks to machines they've compromised to gain persistence.|Persistence|
|**Suspicious file timestamp modification**|Host data analysis detected a suspicious timestamp modification. Attackers often copy timestamps from existing, legitimate files to new tools to avoid detection of these newly dropped files.|Persistence / DefenseEvasion|
|**A new user was added to the sudoers group**|Host data analysis detected that a user was added to the sudoers group, which enables its members to run commands with high privileges.|PrivilegeEscalation|
|**Process associated with digital currency mining detected**|Host data analysis detected the execution of a process that is normally associated with digital currency mining.|Exploitation / Execution|
|**Potential port forwarding to external IP address**|Host data analysis detected the initiation of port forwarding to an external IP address.|Exfiltration / CommandAndControl|
||<a name="alerts-azureappserv"></a><h3>Azure App Service</h3> [Further details and notes](security-center-alerts-compute.md#azure-app-service-)||
|**Suspicious WordPress theme invocation detected**|The App Service activity log indicates a possible code injection activity on your App Service resource.<br>This suspicious activity resembles activity that manipulates a WordPress theme to support server-side execution of code, followed by a direct web request to invoke the manipulated theme file. This type of activity can be part of an attack campaign over WordPress.|-|
|**Web fingerprinting detected**<br>(NMAP / Blind Elephant)|The App Service activity log indicates a possible web fingerprinting activity on your App Service resource.<br>This suspicious activity is associated with a tool called Blind Elephant. The tool fingerprints web servers and tries to detect the installed applications and their versions. Attackers often use this tool for probing the web applications to find vulnerabilities. |-|
|**Suspicious access to possibly vulnerable web page detected**|The App Service activity log indicates that a web page that seems to be sensitive was accessed.<br>This suspicious activity originated from a source address whose access pattern resembles that of a web scanner. This kind of activity is often associated with an attempt by an attacker to scan your network to try to gain access to sensitive or vulnerable web pages. |-|
|**An IP that connected to your Azure App Service FTP Interface was found in Threat Intelligence**|App Service FTP logs analysis has detected a connection from a source address that was found in the threat intelligence feed. During this connection, a user accessed the pages listed.|-|
|**An attempt to run Linux commands on a Windows App Service**|Analysis of App Service processes detected an attempt to run a Linux command on a Windows App Service. This action was running by the web application. This behavior is often seen during campaigns that exploit a vulnerability in a common web application.|-|
|**Suspicious PHP execution detected**|Machine logs indicate that a suspicious PHP process is running. The action included an attempt to run operating system commands or PHP code from the command line, by using the PHP process. While this behavior can be legitimate, in web applications this behavior might indicate malicious activities, such as attempts to infect websites with web shells.|Execution|
|**Process execution from temporary folder**|App Service processes analysis has detected an execution of a process from the app's temporary folder. While this behavior can be legitimate, in web applications this behavior might indicate malicious activities.|-|
|**Attempt to run high privilege command detected**|Analysis of App Service processes has detected an attempt to run a command that requires high privileges. The command ran in the web application context. While this behavior can be legitimate, in web applications this behavior might indicate malicious activities.|-|
|**Saving curl output to disk detected**|Analysis of App Service processes detected the running of a curl command in which the output was saved to the disk. While this behavior can be legitimate, in web applications this behavior is also observed in malicious activities such as attempts to infect websites with web shells.|-|
|**Raw data download detected**|Analysis of App Service processes detected an attempt to download code from raw-data websites such as Pastebin. This action was run by a PHP process. This behavior is associated with attempts to download web shells or other malicious components to the App Service.|-|
|**Vulnerability scanner detected**<br>(Joomla/WordPress/CMS)|The Azure App Service activity log indicates that a possible vulnerability scanner was used on your App Service resource. The suspicious activity detected resembles that of tools targeting Joomla applications / WordPress applications / a content management system (CMS).|-|
|**Spam folder referrer detected**|Azure App Service activity log indicates web activity that was identified as originating from a web site associated with SPAM activity. This could occur if your web site is compromised and used for spam activity.|-|
|**Connection to web page from anomalous IP address detected**|The Azure App Service activity log indicates a connection to a sensitive web page from a source IP address (%{Source IP Address}) that never connect to it before. This might indicate that someone is attempting a brute force attack into your web app administration pages. It might also be the result of a new IP address being used by a legitimate user.|-|
|**Suspicious User Agent detected**|Azure App Service activity log indicates requests with suspicious user agent. This behavior can indicate on attempts to exploit a vulnerability in your App Service application.|-|
|**PHP file in upload folder**|The Azure App Service activity log indicates an access to a suspicious PHP page located in the upload folder. This type of folder does not usually contain PHP files. The existence of this type of file might indicate an exploitation taking advantage of arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities.|-|
|**Anomalous requests pattern detected**|The Azure App Service activity log indicates an anomalous HTTP activity to the App Service from %{Source IP}. This activity resembles a pattern of Fuzzing \ Brute force activity.|-|
||<a name="alerts-akscluster"></a><h3>AKS cluster level</h3> [Further details and notes](security-center-alerts-compute.md#azure-containers-)||
|**PREVIEW - Role binding to the cluster-admin role detected**|Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new binding to the cluster-admin role resulting in administrator privileges. Unnecessarily providing administrator privileges might result in privilege escalation issues in the cluster.|Persistence|
|**PREVIEW - Exposed Kubernetes dashboard detected**|Kubernetes audit log analysis detected exposure of the Kubernetes Dashboard by a LoadBalancer service. Exposed dashboards allow unauthenticated access to the cluster management and pose a security threat.|Persistence|
|**PREVIEW - New high privileges role detected**|Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new role with high privileges. A binding to a role with high privileges gives the user/group elevated privileges in the cluster. Unnecessarily providing elevated privileges might result in privilege escalation issues in the cluster.|Persistence|
|**PREVIEW - New container in the kube-system namespace detected**|Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new container in the kube-system namespace that isn’t among the containers that normally run in this namespace. The kube-system namespaces shouldn't contain user resources. Attackers can use this namespace to hide malicious components.|Persistence|
|**PREVIEW - Digital currency mining container detected**|Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a container that has an image associated with a digital currency mining tool.|Execution|
|**PREVIEW - Privileged container detected**|Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new privileged container. A privileged container has access to the node’s resources and breaks the isolation between containers. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the node.|PrivilegeEscalation|
|**PREVIEW - Container with a sensitive volume mount detected**|Kubernetes audit log analysis detected a new container with a sensitive volume mount. The volume that was detected is a hostPath type that mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount to gain access to the node.|PrivilegeEscalation|
||<a name="alerts-containerhost"></a><h3>Container host level</h3> [Further details and notes](security-center-alerts-compute.md#azure-containers-)||
|**Privileged Container Detected**|Machine logs indicate that a privileged Docker container is running. A privileged container has full access to the host's resources. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the host machine.|PrivilegeEscalation / Execution|
|**Privileged command run in container**|Machine logs indicate that a privileged command was run in a Docker container. A privileged command has extended privileges on the host machine.|PrivilegeEscalation|
|**Exposed Docker daemon detected**|Machine logs indicate that your Docker daemon (dockerd) exposes a TCP socket. By default, Docker configuration doesn't use encryption or authentication when a TCP socket is enabled. Anyone with access to the relevant port can then get full access to the Docker daemon.|Exploitation / Execution|
|**SSH server is running inside a container**|Machine logs indicate that an SSH server is running inside a Docker container. While this behavior can be intentional, it frequently indicates that a container is misconfigured or breached.|Execution|
|**Container with a miner image detected**|Machine logs indicate execution of a Docker container running an image associated with digital currency mining. This behavior can possibly indicate that your resources are being abused.|Execution|
|**Suspicious request to Kubernetes API**|Machine logs indicate that a suspicious request was made to the Kubernetes API. The request was sent from a Kubernetes node, possibly from one of the containers running in the node. Although this behavior can be intentional, it might indicate that the node is running a compromised container.|Execution|
|**Suspicious request to the Kubernetes Dashboard**|Machine logs indicate that a suspicious request was made to the Kubernetes Dashboard. The request was sent from a Kubernetes node, possibly from one of the containers running in the node. Although this behavior can be intentional, it might indicate that the node is running a compromised container.|-|
||<a name="alerts-sql-db-and-warehouse"></a><h3>SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse</h3> [Further details and notes](security-center-alerts-data-services.md#sql-database-and-sql-data-warehouse-) ||
|**A possible vulnerability to SQL Injection**|An application has generated a faulty SQL statement in the database. This can indicate a possible vulnerability to SQL injection attacks. There are two possible reasons for a faulty statement. A defect in application code might have constructed the faulty SQL statement. Or, application code or stored procedures didn't sanitize user input when constructing the faulty SQL statement, which can be exploited for SQL injection.|-|
|**Potential SQL injection**|An active exploit has occurred against an identified application vulnerable to SQL injection. This means an attacker is trying to inject malicious SQL statements by using the vulnerable application code or stored procedures.|-|
|**Logon from an unusual location**|There has been a change in the access pattern to SQL Server, where someone has signed in to the server from an unusual geographical location. In some cases, the alert detects a legitimate action (a new application or developer maintenance). In other cases, the alert detects a malicious action (a former employee or external attacker).|Exploitation|
|**Logon by an unfamiliar principal**|There has been a change in the access pattern to SQL Server. Someone has signed in to the server by using an unusual principal (user). In some cases, the alert detects a legitimate action (a new application or developer maintenance). In other cases, the alert detects a malicious action (a former employee or external attacker).|Exploitation|
|**Attempted logon by a potentially harmful application**|A potentially harmful application has been used to access the database. In some cases, the alert detects penetration testing in action. In other cases, the alert detects an attack that uses common tools.|Probing|
|**Potential SQL Brute Force attempt**|An abnormally high number of failed sign-ins with different credentials have occurred. In some cases, the alert detects penetration testing in action. In other cases, the alert detects a brute force attack.|Probing|
|**Logon from an unusual Azure Data Center**|There has been a change in the access pattern to an SQL Server, where someone has signed in to the server from an unusual Azure Data Center. In some cases, the alert detects a legitimate action (a new application or Azure service). In other cases, the alert detects a malicious action (attacker operating from breached resource in Azure).|Probing|
|**Potentially Unsafe Action**|High privileged SQL command which is commonly used in malicious sessions has been executed in an SQL Server. Those commands are recommended to be disabled by default. In some cases, the alert detects a legitimate action (admin script running). In other cases, the alert detects a malicious action (attacker using SQL trusts to breach Windows layer).|Execution|
|**Unusual export location**|There has been a change in the export storage destination for a SQL import and export operation. In some cases, the alert detects a legitimate change (new backup destination). In other cases, the alert detects a malicious action (attacker easily exfiltrated data to a file).|Exfiltration|
||<a name="alerts-azurestorage"></a><h3>Azure Storage</h3> [Further details and notes](security-center-alerts-data-services.md#azure-storage-)||
|**Access from an unusual location to a storage account**|Indicates that there was a change in the access pattern to an Azure Storage account. Someone has accessed this account from an IP address considered unfamiliar when compared with recent activity. Either an attacker has gained access to the account, or a legitimate user has connected from a new or unusual geographic location. An example of the latter is remote maintenance from a new application or developer.|Exploitation|
|**Unusual application accessed a storage account**|Indicates that an unusual application has accessed this storage account. A potential cause is that an attacker has accessed your storage account by using a new application.|Exploitation|
|**Anonymous access to a storage account**|Indicates that there's a change in the access pattern to a storage account. For instance, the account has been accessed anonymously (without any authentication), which is unexpected compared to the recent access pattern on this account. A potential cause is that an attacker has exploited public read access to a container that holds blob storage.|Exploitation|
|**Access from a Tor exit node to a storage account**|Indicates that this account has been accessed successfully from an IP address that is known as an active exit node of Tor (an anonymizing proxy). The severity of this alert considers the authentication type used (if any), and whether this is the first case of such access. Potential causes can be an attacker who has accessed your storage account by using Tor, or a legitimate user who has accessed your storage account by using Tor.|Probing / Exploitation|
|**Unusual amount of data extracted from a storage account**|Indicates that an unusually large amount of data has been extracted compared to recent activity on this storage container. A potential cause is that an attacker has extracted a large amount of data from a container that holds blob storage.|Exfiltration|
|**Unusual deletion in a storage account**|Indicates that one or more unexpected delete operations has occurred in a storage account, compared to recent activity on this account. A potential cause is that an attacker has deleted data from your storage account.|Exfiltration|
|**Unusual upload of .cspkg to a storage account**|Indicates that an Azure Cloud Services package (.cspkg file) has been uploaded to a storage account in an unusual way, compared to recent activity on this account. A potential cause is that an attacker has been preparing to deploy malicious code from your storage account to an Azure cloud service.|LateralMovement / Execution|
|**Unusual change of access permissions in a storage account**|Indicates that the access permissions of this storage container have been changed in an unusual way. A potential cause is that an attacker has changed container permissions to weaken its security posture or to gain persistence.|Persistence|
|**Unusual access inspection in a storage account**|Indicates that the access permissions of a storage account have been inspected in an unusual way, compared to recent activity on this account. A potential cause is that an attacker has performed reconnaissance for a future attack.|Collection|

A principal that doesn’t regularly use PowerShell to manage the subscription environment is now using PowerShell, and performing actions that can secure persistence for an attacker.|Persistence|
|**Use of advanced Azure persistence techniques**|Subscription activity logs analysis has detected suspicious behavior. Customized roles have been given legitimized identity entities. This can lead the attacker to gain persistency in an Azure customer environment.|-|
|**Activity from infrequent country**|Activity from a location that wasn't recently or ever visited by any user in the organization has occurred.<br>This detection considers past activity locations to determine new and infrequent locations. The anomaly detection engine stores information about previous locations used by users in the organization.|-|
|**Activity from anonymous IP addresses**|Users activity from an IP address that has been identified as an anonymous proxy IP address has been detected.<br>These proxies are used by people who want to hide their device’s IP address, and can be used for malicious intent. This detection uses a machine learning algorithm that reduces false positives, such as mis-tagged IP addresses that are widely used by users in the organization.|-|
|**Impossible travel activity**|Two user activities (in a single or multiple sessions) have occurred, originating from geographically distant locations. This occurs within a time period shorter than the time it would have taken the user to travel from the first location to the second. This indicates that a different user is using the same credentials.<br>This detection uses a machine learning algorithm that ignores obvious false positives contributing to the impossible travel conditions, such as VPNs and locations regularly used by other users in the organization. The detection has an initial learning period of seven days, during which it learns a new user’s activity pattern. |-|
||<a name="alerts-azurekv"></a><h3>Azure Key Vault (Preview)</h3> [Further details and notes](security-center-alerts-service-layer.md#azure-keyvault)||
|**Access from a TOR exit node to a Key Vault**|The Key Vault has been accessed by someone using the TOR IP anonymization system to hide their location. Malicious actors often try to hide their location when attempting to gain unauthorized access to internet-connected resources.|-|
|**Suspicious policy change and secret query in a Key Vault**|A Key Vault policy change has been made and then operations to list and/or get secrets occurred. In addition, this operation pattern isn't normally performed by the user on this vault. This is highly indicative that the Key Vault is compromised and the secrets within have been stolen by a malicious actor.|-|
|**Suspicious secret listing and query in a Key Vault**|A Secret List operation was followed by many Secret Get operations. Also, this operation pattern isn't normally performed by the user on this vault. This indicates that someone could be dumping the secrets stored in the Key Vault for potentially malicious purposes.|-|
|**Unusual user-application pair accessed a Key Vault**|The Key Vault has been accessed by a User-Application pairing that doesn't normally access it. This may be a legitimate access attempt (for example, following an infrastructure or code update). This is also a possible indication that your infrastructure is compromised and a malicious actor is trying to access your Key Vault.|-|
|**Unusual application accessed a Key Vault**|The Key Vault has been accessed by an Application that doesn't normally access it. This may be a legitimate access attempt (for example, following an infrastructure or code update). This is also a possible indication that your infrastructure is compromised and a malicious actor is trying to access your Key Vault.|-|
|**Unusual user accessed a Key Vault**|The Key Vault has been accessed by a User that doesn't normally access it. This may be a legitimate access attempt (for example, a new user needing access has joined the organization). This is also a possible indication that your infrastructure is compromised and a malicious actor is trying to access your Key Vault.|-|
|**Unusual operation pattern in a Key Vault**|An unusual set of Key Vault operations has been performed compared with historical data. Key Vault activity is typically the same over time. This may be a legitimate change in activity. Alternatively, your infrastructure might be compromised and further investigations are necessary.|-|
|**High volume of operations in a Key Vault**|A larger volume of Key Vault operations has been performed compared with historical data. Key Vault activity is typically the same over time. This may be a legitimate change in activity. Alternatively, your infrastructure might be compromised and further investigations are necessary.|-|

## Intentions

Understanding the intention of an attack can help you investigate and report the event more easily. Azure Security Center alerts include the 'intent' field to help with these efforts.

The series of steps that describe the progression of a cyberattack from reconnaissance to data exfiltration is often referred to as a "kill chain". 

Security Center's supported kill chain intents are based on the [MITRE ATT&CK™ framework](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/eh) and described in the table below.

|Intent|Description|
|------|-------|
|**Probing**|Probing could be either an attempt to access a certain resource regardless of a malicious intent, or a failed attempt to gain access to a target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is usually detected as an attempt, originating from outside the network, to scan the target system and identify an entry point.|
|**Exploitation**|Exploitation is the stage where an attacker manages to get a foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is relevant for compute hosts and resources such as user accounts, certificates etc. Threat actors will often be able to control the resource after this stage.|
|**Persistence**|Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a system that gives a threat actor a persistent presence on that system. Threat actors will often need to maintain access to systems through interruptions such as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures that would require a remote access tool to restart or provide an alternate backdoor for them to regain access.|
|**PrivilegeEscalation**|Privilege escalation is the result of actions that allow an adversary to obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or network. Certain tools or actions require a higher level of privilege to work and are likely necessary at many points throughout an operation. User accounts with permissions to access specific systems or perform specific functions necessary for adversaries to achieve their objective may also be considered an escalation of privilege.|
|**DefenseEvasion**|Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are the same as (or variations of) techniques in other categories that have the added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation.|
|**CredentialAccess**|Credential access represents techniques resulting in access to or control over system, domain, or service credentials that are used within an enterprise environment. Adversaries will likely attempt to obtain legitimate credentials from users or administrator accounts (local system administrator or domain users with administrator access) to use within the network. With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create accounts for later use within the environment.|
|**Discovery**|Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides many native tools that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase.|
|**LateralMovement**|Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The lateral movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information from a system without needing additional tools, such as a remote access tool. An adversary can use lateral movement for many purposes, including remote Execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, access to specific information or files, access to additional credentials, or to cause an effect.|
|**Execution**|The execution tactic represents techniques that result in execution of adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system. This tactic is often used in conjunction with lateral movement to expand access to remote systems on a network.|
