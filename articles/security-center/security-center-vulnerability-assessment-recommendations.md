# Vulnerability assessment in Azure Security Center

The vulnerability assessment in Azure Security Center is part of the Security Center virtual machine (VM) recommendations. If Security Center doesn't find a vulnerability assessment solution installed on your VM, it recommends that you install one. A partner agent, after being deployed, starts reporting vulnerability data to the partner’s management platform. In turn, the partner's management platform provides vulnerability and health monitoring data back to Security Center. You can quickly identify vulnerable VMs on the Security Center. You can get more reports and information by switching to the partner management console directly from Security Center.

Some important observations regarding this capability:

* Currently, a vulnerability assessment is available from [Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/lp/azure). More partners will be added in the future.
* You can install the vulnerability assessment solution in multiple VMs. The VMs must belong to the same subscription.
* Only Windows VMs are supported. Linux VMs will be added for general availability (GA).

> [!NOTE]
> This article  introduces the vulnerability assessment service by using an example deployment. This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement a vulnerability assessment recommendation
When Security Center identifies one or more supported VMs that are missing a vulnerability assessment solution, it triggers a VM recommendation. The following steps show you how to access and apply this recommendation for multiple VMs that are in the same subscription:

1. In the **Overview** section, click **Recommendations**.
2. On the **Recommendations** blade, select **Add a vulnerability assessment solution**:

3. On the **Add a vulnerability assessment solution** blade, select the VMs where you want to install the vulnerability assessment solution:

4. Click **Install on 2 VMs** (the name might vary according to the number of VMs that you selected):

    ![Add a Vulnerability Assessment blade](./media/security-center-vulnerability-assessment-recommendations/security-center-vulnerability-assessment-fig3-new.png)
5. On the **Add Vulnerability Assessment** blade, you can create a new vulnerability assessment. If you create a new vulnerability assessment, you can select a partner solution in the **Azure Marketplace**. Or, under "Use existing solution, select **Qualys**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can change auto update settings. On the **Partner Solutions** blade, select the partner solution, and then click **Configure**. On the **Configure security solution** blade, for **Auto update**, select **ON** or **OFF**. 

## Create a new vulnerability assessment solution
If you have multiple subscriptions, you can create one vulnerability assessment solution for each subscription. The main steps are the same as described in the previous section. The only difference is that in step 4, select the **Create New** option. After you select this option, complete the following steps.

> [!NOTE]
> The following example uses Qualys. To deploy a Qualys cloud agent from Security Center, you need a license code and public key from Qualys. To learn how to retrieve the license code and public keye, see the [Qualys documentation](https://community.qualys.com/docs/DOC-5823-deploying-qualys-cloud-agents-from-microsoft-azure-security-center).


1. On the **Create a new Vulnerability Assessment** blade, click the partner’s name. In this case, click **Qualys**.
2. The partner’s blade opens. The fields shown in this blade might change depending on the partner. For this example use **Qualys**:

    ![Create a new vulnerability assessment solution](./media/security-center-vulnerability-assessment-recommendations/security-center-vulnerability-assessment-fig4-new.png)
3. In the **Resource group** box, select an existing resource group.
4. In the **Location** box, select where this solution will be geographically located.
5. In the **License code** box (this is specific for Qualys), type the license number provided by the partner.
6. In the **Public key** box (this is specific for Qualys), type the public key information provided by the partner.
7. If you want to automatically install a vulnerability assessment agent on all discovered VMs in the subscription of this Qualys solution, select the **Auto update** check box.
8. Click **OK**.

## Review the recommendation
After the vulnerability assessment solution is installed on the target VM, it scans the VM to detect and identify system and application vulnerabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take a couple of hours for the first scan to complete. After that, it is an hourly process.

These issues are surfaced under the **Virtual Machines Recommendations** options. The following example shows how the recommendation appears on the **Recommendations** blade:

![Recommendations blade](./media/security-center-vulnerability-assessment-recommendations/security-center-vulnerability-assessment-fig5-new.png)

In this example, the selected recommendation shows that the detection was performed by Qualys. If you click this recommendation, a new blade with a list of vulnerabilities appears:

![Remediate vulnerabilities blade](./media/security-center-vulnerability-assessment-recommendations/security-center-vulnerability-assessment-fig6-new.png)

This list shows all vulnerability in order of severity, and the number of virtual machines that are affected by this vulnerability. For this example, the vulnerability **Enable DCOM** was selected. A new blade appears, with the recommended steps to address this vulnerability:
