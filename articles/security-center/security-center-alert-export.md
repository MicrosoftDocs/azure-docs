# Export Azure Security Center alerts
This article explains how to export the alerts generated by Security Center to a format that can be used by other tools.

You can then run the alerts through the other tools which can process, analyze, and take action as needed.

## Prerequisites
You need a Log Analytics workspace.  


1. Click **Security Policy**.
1. In the line of the subscription that you want to use, click **Edit Settings**.
  ![Edit settings](./media/security-center-alert-export/edit_settings.png "Edit settings")
1. Click **Data Collection**.
1. Scroll down to **Store Security Center enriched data** and click the toggle option to **On**.

   ![Store data option](./media/security-center-alert-export/store_data_option.png "Security Policy")
1. Select the workspace that you want to export the alerts to.
 
    > [!NOTE] You cannot export log alerts to the Security Center default workspace. We recommend that you use the same Log Analytics workspace that you created when setting for collecting data. [Log Analytics workspace for data collection](security-center-enable-data-collection.md)

1. Click **Save** (at the top of the screen).
1. Check the Log Analytics workspace and see that it is consistent with the data in Security Center.
