# Security recommendations - a reference guide

This article lists the recommendations you might see in Azure Security Center. The recommendations shown in your environment depend on the resources you're protecting and your customized configuration.

To learn about how to respond to these recommendations, see [Remediate recommendations in Azure Security Center](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md).

Your Secure Score is based on the number of Security Center recommendations you've completed. To decide which  recommendations to resolve first, look at the severity of each one and its potential impact on your Secure Score.

>[!TIP]
> If a recommendation's description says "No related policy", it's usually because that recommendation is dependent on a different recommendation and *its* policy. For example, the recommendation "Endpoint protection health failures should be remediated...", relies on the recommendation that checks whether an endpoint protection solution is even *installed* ("Endpoint protection solution should be installed..."). The underlying recommendation *does* have a policy. Limiting the policies to only the foundational recommendation simplifies policy management.

|Recommendation|Description & related policy|Severity|Quick fix enabled?([Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-remediate-recommendations#recommendations-with-quick-fix-remediation))|Resource type|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|**Adaptive Network Hardening recommendations should be applied on internet facing virtual machines**|Customers on the standard pricing tier will see this recommendation when the Adaptive Network Hardening feature finds an overly-permissive NSG rule.<br>(Related policy: Adaptive Network Hardening recommendations should be applied on internet facing virtual machines)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**All network ports should be restricted on NSG associated to your VM**|Harden the network security groups of your Internet-facing VMs by restricting the access of your existing allow rules.<br>This recommendation is triggered when any port is opened to *all* sources (except for ports 22, 3389, 5985, 5986, 80, and 1443).<br>(Related policy: Access through internet facing endpoint should be restricted)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled**|Protect virtual networks containing applications with public IPs by enabling DDoS protection service standard. DDoS protection enables mitigation of network volumetric and protocol attacks.<br>(Related policy: DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled)|High|N|Virtual network|
|**Function App should only be accessible over HTTPS**|Enable "HTTPS only" access for function apps. Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks.<br>(Related policy: Function App should only be accessible over HTTPS)|Medium|**Y**|Function app|
|**Internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with Network Security Groups**|Enable Network Security Groups to control network access of your virtual machines.<br>(Related policy: Internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with Network Security Groups)|High/ Medium|N|Virtual machine|
|**IP forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled**|Disable IP forwarding. When IP forwarding is enabled on a virtual machine's NIC, the machine can receive traffic addressed to other destinations. IP forwarding is rarely required (for example, when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: IP Forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled)|Medium|N|Virtual machine|
|**Management ports of virtual machines should be protected with just-in-time network access control**|Apply just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine (VM) access control to permanently lock down access to selected ports, and enable authorized users to open them, via JIT, for a limited amount of time only.<br>(Related policy: Management ports of virtual machines should be protected with just-in-time network access control)|High|N|Virtual machine|

Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.<br>(Related policy: Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled)|High|**Y**|Storage account|
