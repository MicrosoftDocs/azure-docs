# Security recommendations - a reference guide

This article lists the recommendations you might see in Azure Security Center. The recommendations shown in your environment depend on the resources you're protecting and your customized configuration.

To learn about how to respond to these recommendations, see [Remediate recommendations in Azure Security Center](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md).

Your secure score is based on how many Security Center recommendations you have mitigated. To prioritize the recommendations to resolve first, consider the severity of each.
