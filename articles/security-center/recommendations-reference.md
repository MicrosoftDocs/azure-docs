# Security recommendations - a reference guide

This article lists the recommendations you might see in Azure Security Center. The available recommendations in your environment depend on the resources you're protecting and your customized configuration.

To learn about how to respond to these recommendations, see [Remediate recommendations in Azure Security Center](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md).

Your secure score is based on how many Security Center recommendations you have mitigated. To prioritize the recommendations to resolve first, consider the severity of each, as well as the Security Controls described in [Secure Score and Security Controls]().  

## Azure Security Center recommendations

|----|----|----|----|----|
||<a name="recs-network"></a><h3>Network recommendations - regarding your network's topology and internet facing endpoints|
|**Just-in-time network access control should be applied on virtual machines**|Apply just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine (VM) access control to permanently lock down access to selected ports, and enable authorized users to open them, via JIT, for a limited amount of time only.<br>(Related policy: Just-In-Time network access control should be applied on virtual machines)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**Network security groups on the subnet level should be enabled**|Enable network security groups to control network access of resources deployed in your subnets.<br>(Related policy: Subnets should be associated with a Network Security Group)|High/ Medium|N|Subnet|
|**Virtual machines should be associated with a network security group**|Enable Network Security Groups to control network access of your virtual machines.<br>(Related policy: Virtual machines should be associated with a Network Security Group)|High/ Medium|N|Virtual machine|
|**Access should be restricted for permissive network security groups with Internet-facing VMs**|Harden the network security groups of your Internet-facing VMs by restricting the access of your existing allow rules.<br>(Related policy: Network Security Group Rules for Internet facing virtual machines should be hardened)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**The rules for web applications on IaaS NSGs should be hardened**|Harden the network security group (NSG) of your virtual machines that are running web applications, with NSG rules that are overly permissive with regards to web application ports.<br>(Related policy: The NSGs rules for web applications on IaaS should be hardened)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**Access to App Services should be restricted**|Restrict access to your App Services by changing the networking configuration, to deny inbound traffic from ranges that are too broad.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Access to App Services should be restricted)|High|N|App service|
|**Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines**|Harden the network security group of your virtual machines to restrict access to management ports.<br>(Related policy: Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines)|High|N|Virtual machine|
|**DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled**|Protect virtual networks containing applications with public IPs by enabling DDoS protection service standard.

When your compliance and security requirement requires you to encrypt the data end to end using your encryption keys, including encryption of the ephemeral (locally attached temporary) disk, use Azure disk encryption. Alternatively, by default, Managed Disks are encrypted at rest by default using Azure Storage Service Encryption where the encryption keys are Microsoft-managed keys in Azure.
