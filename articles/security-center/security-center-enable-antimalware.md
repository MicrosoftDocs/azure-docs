# Enable antimalware in Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center will recommend that you provision an antimalware program to your Azure virtual machines if antimalware is not already enabled. This recommendation applies to Windows VMs only.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The information in this document applies to the preview release of Azure Security Center. This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation

1. In the **Recommendations** blade, select **Enable Antimalware**.
![][1]

2. In the **Install Antimalware** blade select from the list of virtual machines without antimalware enabled and click **Install Antimalware**.
3. The **New resource** blade opens to allow you to select the antimalware solution you want to use. Select **Microsoft Antimalware**.
![][2]

4. Additional information about the antimalware solution is displayed. Select **Create**.
5. Enter the required configuration settings on the **Add Extension** blade, and then select **OK**.

[Microsoft Antimalware](../azure-security-antimalware.md) is now active on the selected virtual machine.
