# Introduction to Azure Defender for Storage

**Azure Defender for Storage** detects potentially harmful activity on your Azure Storage accounts. Your data can be protected whether it's stored as blob containers, file shares, or data lakes.

This layer of protection allows you to address threats *without* requiring you to be a security expert, and helps you manage your security monitoring systems.

## What kind of alerts does Azure Defender for Storage provide?

Security alerts are triggered when there's:

- **Suspicious activity** - for example, the storage account has been accessed successfully from an IP address that is known as an active exit node of Tor
- **Anomalous behavior** - for example, changes in the access pattern to a storage account
- **Potential malware uploaded** - hash reputation analysis indicates that an uploaded file contains malware

Alerts include details of the incident that triggered them, as well as recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats.

> [!TIP]
> You can simulate storage alerts by following the instructions in [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/validating-atp-for-azure-storage-detections-in-azure-security/ba-p/1068131).


## What is hash reputation analysis for malware?

To determine whether an uploaded file is suspicious, Azure Defender for Storage uses hash reputation analysis supported by [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684). The threat protection tools don’t scan the uploaded files, rather they examine the storage logs and compare the hashes of newly uploaded files with those of known viruses, trojans, spyware, and ransomware. 

When a file is suspected to contain malware, Security Center displays an alert and can optionally email the storage owner for approval to delete the suspicious file. To set up this automatic removal of files that hash reputation analysis indicates contain malware, deploy a [workflow automation to trigger on alerts that contain "Potential malware uploaded to a storage account”](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/how-to-respond-to-potential-malware-uploaded-to-azure-storage/ba-p/1452005).

> [!NOTE]
> To enable Security Center's threat protection capabilities, you must enable Azure Defender on the subscription containing the applicable workloads.
>
> You can enable **Azure Defender for Storage** at either the subscription level or resource level.
