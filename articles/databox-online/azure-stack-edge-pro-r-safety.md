## Handling precautions and site selection

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png) **WARNING:**

* Proper equipment (for instance, pallet jack) and personal protective equipment (PPE), for instance, gloves must be used when moving and handling the as-shipped device.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)![Tip Hazard Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-tip-hazard.png) **WARNING:**

* Place the equipment on a flat, hard, and stable surface to avoid a potential tip or crushing hazard.
* Do not stack more than 2 devices on each other.
* Ensure system is secure prior to stacking.
* Do not relocate or move stacked devices.
* Do not stack devices that are energized with external cables.
* Ensure power cords are not crushed or damaged during stacking operations.
* Devices are not to be used as tables or workspaces.

![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png)
![No User Serviceable Parts Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-do-not-access.png) **CAUTION:**

* Inspect the *as-received* device for damages. If the device enclosure is damaged, [contact Microsoft Support](azure-stack-edge-contact-microsoft-support.md) to obtain a replacement. Do not attempt to operate the device.
* If you suspect the device is malfunctioning, [contact Microsoft Support](azure-stack-edge-contact-microsoft-support.md) to obtain a replacement. Do not attempt to service the device.
* The device contains no user-serviceable parts. Hazardous voltage, current, and energy levels are present inside. Do not open. Return the device to Microsoft for servicing.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png) ![Heavy Weight Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-heavy-weight.png) **WARNING:**

* Do not try to lift an Azure Stack Edge Pro R Edge device by yourself. An enclosure can weigh up between 35 kg and 88 kg (78 lbs and 193 lbs); use mechanical assistance or other suitable assistance when moving and lifting equipment. Conform to local occupational health and safety requirements when moving and lifting equipment.
* Do not attempt lifting the equipment without proper mechanical aid. Be aware that attempting to lift this weight can cause severe injuries.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)  **WARNING:**

* The system is designed to operate in a controlled environment. Choose a site that is:
  * Well-ventilated and away from sources of heat including direct sunlight and radiators.
  * Not exposed to moisture or rain.
  * Located in a space that minimizes vibration and physical shock.  The system is designed for shock and vibration according to MIL-STD-810G.
  * Isolated from strong electromagnetic fields produced by electrical devices.
  * Provided with properly grounded outlets.
  * Provided with adequate space to access the power supply cord(s), because they serve as the product's main power disconnect.
* Set up the equipment in a work area allowing for adequate air circulation around the equipment; ensure that the front and back covers are fully removed while the device is running.
* Install the equipment in temperature-controlled area free of conductive contaminants and allow for adequate air circulation around the equipment.
* Keep the equipment away from sources of liquid and excessively humid environments.
* Do not allow any liquid or any foreign object to enter the system. Do not place beverages or any other liquid containers on or near the system.


## Electrical precautions

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png) ![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png) **WARNING:**

* Provide a safe electrical earth connection to the power supply cord. The alternating current (AC) cord has a three-wire grounding plug (a plug that has a grounding pin). This plug fits only a grounded AC outlet. Do not defeat the purpose of the grounding pin.
* Given that the plug on the power supply cord is the main disconnect device, ensure that the socket outlets are located near the device and are easily accessible.
* Unplug the power cord(s) (by pulling the plug, not the cord) and disconnect all cables if any of the following conditions exist:

  * The power cord or plug becomes frayed or otherwise damaged.
  * You spill something into the device casing.
  * The device is exposed to rain or excess moisture.
  * The device was dropped and the device casing is damaged.
  * You suspect the device needs service or repair.
* Permanently unplug the unit before you move it or if you think it has become damaged in any way.
* Provide a suitable power source with electrical overload protection to meet the following power specifications:

  * Voltage: 100 to 240 Volts AC
  * Current: 20 A, maximum per power cord. Power cord(s) are provided.
  * Frequency: 50 to 60 Hz

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)
![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png)
![Multiple Power Sources](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-disconnect-all-power.png) **WARNING:**

* For systems without an uninterrupted power supply (UPS), unplug all AC power cord(s) to completely remove AC power from the equipment.
* For systems with UPS, unplug all AC power cord(s) and use the UPS power switch to de-energize the System. UPS contains hazardous AC and DC voltages.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)
![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png) **WARNING:**

* For systems equipped with UPS, AC and/or DC voltage will always involve a potential risk of AC voltage at UPS output generated from either batteries or utility. To avoid equipment damage or personal injury, always assume that there may be voltage at the UPS output, even when disconnected from the primary power source.
* For systems equipped with UPS, all UPS energized external connections are female. Do not remove the case or insert anything into these or any connectors on the UPS.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)
![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png) **WARNING:**

* Do not attempt to modify or use AC power cord(s) other than the ones provided with the equipment.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)
![No User Serviceable Parts Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-do-not-access.png) **CAUTION:**

* This equipment contains lithium coin cell and/or lithium iron phosphate batteries. Do not attempt servicing the equipment. Batteries in this equipment are not user serviceable. Risk of explosion if battery is replaced by an incorrect type.
