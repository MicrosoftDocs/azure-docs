## Electrical precautions

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png) ![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png) **WARNING:**

* Provide a safe electrical earth connection to the power supply cord. The alternating current (AC) cord has a three-wire grounding plug (a plug that has a grounding pin). This plug fits only a grounded AC outlet. Do not defeat the purpose of the grounding pin.
* Given that the plug on the power supply cord is the main disconnect device, ensure that the socket outlets are located near the device and are easily accessible.
* Unplug the power cord(s) (by pulling the plug, not the cord) and disconnect all cables if any of the following conditions exist:

  * The power cord or plug becomes frayed or otherwise damaged.
  * You spill something into the device casing.
  * The device is exposed to rain or excess moisture.
  * The device was dropped and the device casing is damaged.
  * You suspect the device needs service or repair.
* Permanently unplug the unit before you move it or if you think it has become damaged in any way.
* To prevent high leakage current, when a single transit case has more than one uninterrupted power supply (UPS), it is recommended that each UPS is connected to an independent branch circuit. However, in the event that a power distribution unit (PDU) or other device is used where the safety ground of each UPS relies on a single feeder grounding conductor of the PDU, the grounding terminal on the exterior of each UPS must also be used with a supplemental building ground conductor.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If a PDU is used which already has a supplemental grounding conductor, using the additional grounding terminal on the UPS is not required.

* Provide a suitable power source with electrical overload protection to meet the following power specifications:

  * Voltage: 100 to 240 Volts AC
  * Current: 20 A, maximum per power cord. Power cord(s) are provided.
  * Frequency: 50 to 60 Hz

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)

![Multiple Power Sources](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-disconnect-all-power.png) **WARNING:**

* For systems without an uninterrupted power supply (UPS), unplug all AC power cord(s) to completely remove AC power from the equipment.
* For systems with UPS, unplug all AC power cord(s) and use the UPS power switch to de-energize the System. UPS contains hazardous AC and DC voltages.
* If a system includes a UPS, the UPS was provided with a shielded input power cable. You must use the shielded input power cable, do not replace or modify the cord.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)
![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png) **WARNING:**

* For systems equipped with UPS, AC and/or DC voltage will always involve a potential risk of AC voltage at UPS output generated from either batteries or utility. To avoid equipment damage or personal injury, always assume that there may be voltage at the UPS output, even when disconnected from the primary power source.
* For systems equipped with UPS, all UPS energized external connections are female. Do not remove the case or insert anything into these or any connectors on the UPS.

![Warning Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)
![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-r-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png) **WARNING:**

* Do not attempt to modify or use AC power cord(s) other than the ones provided with the equipment.
