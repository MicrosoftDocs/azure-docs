# Deployment checklist for your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device  

This article describes the information that can be gathered ahead of the actual deployment of your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. 

Use the following checklist to ensure you have this information after you’ve placed an order for an Azure Stack Edge Pro device and before you’ve received the device.

| Network readiness                 | Check to see how ready your network is for the deployment of an Azure Stack Edge device. |[Use the Azure Stack Network Readiness Checker](azure-stack-edge-deploy-check-network-readiness.md) to test all needed connections. |
| First-time device connection      | Laptop whose IPv4 settings can be changed. <!--<li> A minimum of 1 GbE switch must be used for the device once the initial setup is complete. The local web UI will not be accessible if the connected switch is not at least 1 Gbe.</li>-->| If connecting Port 1 directly to a laptop (without a switch), use an Ethernet crossover cable or a USB to Ethernet adaptor. |
| Device sign-in                      | Device administrator password, between 8 and 16 characters, including three of the following character types: uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.                                            | Default password is *Password1*, which expires at first sign-in.                                                     |
| Network settings                  | Device comes with 2 x 1-GbE, 4 x 25-GbE network ports. <ul><li>Port 1 is used for initial configuration only. One or more data ports can be connected and configured. </li><li>At least one data network interface from among Port 2 - Port 6 needs to be connected to the Internet (with connectivity to Azure).</li><li>DHCP and static IPv4 configuration supported.</li></ul> | Static IPv4 configuration requires IP, DNS server, and default gateway.   |
| Advanced networking settings     | <ul><li>Require 2 free, static, contiguous IPs for Kubernetes nodes, and one static IP for IoT Edge service.</li><li>Require one additional IP for each extra service or module that you'll deploy.</li></ul>| Only static IPv4 configuration is supported.|
| (Optional) Web proxy settings     | <ul><li>Web proxy server IP/FQDN, port </li><li>Web proxy username, password</li></ul> |  |
| Firewall and port settings        | If using firewall, make sure the [listed URLs patterns and ports](azure-stack-edge-system-requirements.md#networking-port-requirements) are allowed for device IPs. |  |
| (Recommended) Time settings       | Configure time zone, primary NTP server, secondary NTP server. | Configure primary and secondary NTP server on local network.<br>If local server isn’t available, public NTP servers can be   configured.                                                    |
| (Optional) Update server settings | Require update server IP address on local network, path to WSUS server. | By default, public Windows update server is used.|
| Device settings | <ul><li>Device fully qualified domain name (FQDN) </li><li>DNS domain</li></ul> | |
| (Optional) Certificates  | To test non-production workloads, use [Generate certificates option](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-certificates.md#generate-device-certificates). <br><br> If you bring your own certificates including the signing chain(s), [Add certificates](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-certificates.md#bring-your-own-certificates) in appropriate format.| Configure certificates only if you change the device name and/or DNS domain. |
| Activation  | Require activation key from the Azure Stack Edge resource.    | Once generated, the key expires in three days. |
