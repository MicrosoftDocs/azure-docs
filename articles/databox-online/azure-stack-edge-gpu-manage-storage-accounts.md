# Use the Azure portal to manage Edge storage accounts on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

This article describes how to manage Edge storage accounts and local storage accounts on your Azure Stack Edge. You can manage the Azure Stack Edge Pro device via the Azure portal or via the local web UI. Use the Azure portal to add or delete Edge storage accounts on your device. Use Azure PowerShell to add local storage accounts on your device.

## About Edge storage accounts

You can transfer data from your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device via the SMB, NFS, or REST protocols. To transfer data to Blob storage using the REST APIs, you need to create Edge storage accounts on your device. 

The Edge storage accounts that you add on the Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device are mapped to Azure Storage accounts. Any data written to the Edge storage accounts is automatically pushed to the cloud.

A diagram detailing the two types of accounts and how the data flows from each of these accounts to Azure is shown below:

In this article, you learn how to:

## Add an Edge storage account

To create an Edge storage account, do the following procedure:

[!INCLUDE [Add an Edge storage account](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-gateway-add-storage-account.md)]

## Create a local storage account

[!INCLUDE [azure-stack-edge-gpu-create-storage-account](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-gpu-create-storage-account.md)]

## Get access keys for a local storage account

Before you get the access keys, you must configure your client to connect to the device via Azure Resource Manager over Azure PowerShell. For detailed instructions, seeâ€¯[Connect to Azure Resource Manager on your Azure Stack Edge device](azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md).

[!INCLUDE [Get access keys](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-gpu-get-access-keys-for-local-storage-account.md)]

## Delete an Edge storage account

Take the following steps to delete an Edge storage account.

1. Go to **Configuration > Storage accounts** in your resource. From the list of storage accounts, select the storage account you want to delete. From the top command bar, select **Delete storage account**.

2. In the **Delete storage account** blade, confirm the storage account to delete and select **Delete**.

    ![Confirm and delete storage account](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-storage-accounts/delete-edge-storage-account-2.png)

The list of storage accounts is updated to reflect the deletion.

## Add, delete a container

You can also add or delete the containers for these storage accounts.

To add a container, take the following steps:

1. Select the storage account that you want to manage. From the top command bar, select **+ Add container**.

    ![Select storage account to add container](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-storage-accounts/add-container-1.png)

2. Provide a name for your container. This container is created in your Edge storage account as well as the Azure storage account mapped to this account. 

    ![Add Edge container](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-storage-accounts/add-container-2.png)

The list of containers is updated to reflect the newly added container.

![Updated list of containers](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-storage-accounts/add-container-4.png)

You can now select a container from this list and select **+ Delete container** from the top command bar.

## Sync storage keys

Each Azure Storage account has two 512-bit storage access keys that are used for authentication when the storage account is accessed. One of these two keys must be supplied when your Azure Stack Edge device accesses your cloud storage service provider (in this case, Azure).

> [!NOTE]
> Access to your Azure Storage Account using storage access keys from an Azure Stack Edge Pro device has been deprecated in 2501. Tiering data from an Azure Stack Edge Pro device to the mapped Azure Storage account uses Managed Service Identity to authorize the data access from 2501. For more information, see [Assign an Azure role for access to blob data](../storage/blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access.md?tabs=portal#assign-an-azure-role).

An Azure administrator can regenerate or change the access key by directly accessing the storage account (via the Azure Storage service). The Azure Stack Edge service and the device do not see this change automatically.
 
To inform Azure Stack Edge of the change, you will need to access the Azure Stack Edge service, access the storage account, and then synchronize the access key. The service then gets the latest key, encrypts the keys, and sends the encrypted key to the device. When the device gets the new key, it can continue to transfer data to the Azure Storage account. 
 
To provide the new keys to the device, access the Azure portal and synchronize storage access keys. Take the following steps: 

1. In your resource, select the storage account that you want to manage. From the top command bar, select **Sync storage key**.

    ![Select sync storage key](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-storage-accounts/sync-storage-key-1.png)

2. When prompted for confirmation, select **Yes**.
