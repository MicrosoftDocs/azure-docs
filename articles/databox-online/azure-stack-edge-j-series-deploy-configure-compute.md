# Tutorial: Transform data with Azure Stack Edge Pro

<!--[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-all-sku.md)]-->

This tutorial describes how to configure a compute role on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device. After you configure the compute role, Azure Stack Edge Pro can transform data before sending it to Azure.

This procedure can take around 10 to 15 minutes to complete.


In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

Before you set up a compute role on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device, make sure that:
- You've activated your Azure Stack Edge Pro device as described in [Activate your Azure Stack Edge Pro](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-activate.md).


## Configure compute

To configure compute on your Azure Stack Edge Pro, you'll create an IoT Hub resource.

1. In the Azure portal of your Azure Stack Edge resource, go to **Overview**, and select **IoT Edge**.

2. In **Enable IoT Edge service**, select **Add**.

   ![Configure compute](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/configure-compute-2.png)

3. In **Create IoT Edge service**, enter settings for your IoT Hub resource:

   |Field   |Value    |
   |--------|---------|
   |Subscription      | Subscription used by the Azure Stack Edge resource. |
   |Resource group    | Resource group used by the Azure Stack Edge resource. |
   |IoT Hub           | Choose from **Create new** or **Use existing**. <br> By default, a Standard tier (S1) is used to create an IoT resource. To use a free tier IoT resource, create one and then select the existing resource. <br> In each case, the IoT Hub resource uses the same subscription and resource group that is used by the Azure Stack Edge resource.     |
   |Name              | If you don't want to use the default name provided for a new IoT Hub resource, enter a different name. |

    ![Get started with compute 2](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/configure-compute-3.png)

4. When you finish the settings, select **Review + Create**. Review the settings for your IoT Hub resource, and select **Create**.

   Resource creation for an IoT Hub resource takes several minutes. After the resource is created, the **Overview** indicates the IoT Edge service is now running.

    ![Get started with compute 3](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/configure-compute-4.png)

5. To confirm the Edge compute role has been configured, select **Properties**.

   ![Get started with compute 4](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/configure-compute-5.png)

   When the Edge compute role is set up on the Edge device, it creates two devices: an IoT device and an IoT Edge device. Both devices can be viewed in the IoT Hub resource. An IoT Edge Runtime is also running on this IoT Edge device. At this point, only the Linux platform is available for your IoT Edge device.


## Add shares

For the simple deployment in this tutorial, you'll need two shares: one Edge share and another Edge local share.

1. Add an Edge share on the device by doing the following steps:

    1. In your Azure Stack Edge resource, go to **Edge compute > Get started**.
    2. On the **Add share(s)** tile, select **Add**.

        ![Add share tile](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/add-share-1.png) 

    3. On the **Add share** blade, provide the share name and select the share type.
    4. To mount the Edge share, select the check box for **Use the share with Edge compute**.
    5. Select the **Storage account**, **Storage service**, an existing user, and then select **Create**.

        ![Add an Edge share](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/add-edge-share-1.png) 

    If you created a local NFS share, use the following remote sync (`rsync`) command option to copy files onto the share:

    `rsync <source file path> < destination file path>`

    For more information about the `rsync` command, go to [`Rsync` documentation](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/rsync.htm).

    > [!NOTE]
    > To mount NFS share to compute, the compute network must be configured on same subnet as NFS Virtual IP address. For details on how to configure compute network, go to [Enable compute network on your Azure Stack Edge Pro](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-network-compute-web-proxy.md).

    The Edge share is created, and you'll receive a successful creation notification. The share list might be updated, but you must wait for the share creation to be completed.

2. Add an Edge local share on the Edge device by repeating all the steps in the preceding step and selecting the check box for **Configure as Edge local share**. The data in the local share stays on the device.

    ![Add an Edge local share](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/add-edge-share-2.png)

  
3. Select **Add share(s)** to see the updated list of shares.

    ![Updated list of shares](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/add-edge-share-3.png) 
 

## Add a module

You could add a custom or a pre-built module. There are no custom modules on this Edge device. To learn how to create a custom module, go to [Develop a C# module for your Azure Stack Edge Pro device](./azure-stack-edge-gpu-create-iot-edge-module.md).

In this section, you add a custom module to the IoT Edge device that you created in [Develop a C# module for your Azure Stack Edge Pro](./azure-stack-edge-gpu-create-iot-edge-module.md). This custom module takes files from an Edge local share on the Edge device and moves them to an Edge (cloud) share on the device. The cloud share then pushes the files to the Azure storage account that's associated with the cloud share.

1. Go to **Edge compute > Get started**. On the **Add modules** tile, select the scenario type as **simple**. Select **Add**.
2. In the **Configure and add module** blade, input the following values:

    
    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Name     | A unique name for the module. This module is a docker container that you can deploy to the IoT Edge device that's associated with your Azure Stack Edge Pro.        |
    |Image URI     | The image URI for the corresponding container image for the module.        |
    |Credentials required     | If checked, username and password are used to retrieve modules with a matching URL.        |
    |Input share     | Select an input share. The Edge local share is the input share in this case. The module used here moves files from the Edge local share to an Edge share where they are uploaded into the cloud.        |
    |Output share     | Select an output share. The Edge share is the output share in this case.        |
    |Trigger type     | Select from **File** or **Schedule**. A file trigger fires whenever a file event occurs such as a file is written to the input share. A scheduled trigger fires up based on a schedule defined by you.         |
    |Trigger name     | A unique name for your trigger.         |
    |Environment variables| Optional information that will help define the environment in which your module will run.   |

    ![Add and configure module](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/add-module-1.png)

3. Select **Add**. The module gets added. Go to the **Overview** page. The **Modules** tile updates to indicate that the module is deployed. 

    ![Module deployed](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/add-module-2.png)

### Verify data transform and transfer

The final step is to ensure that the module is connected and running as expected. The run-time status of the module should be running for your IoT Edge device in the IoT Hub resource.

To verify that the module is running, do the following:

1. Select the **Add module** tile. This takes you to the **Modules** blade. In the list of modules, identify the module you deployed. The runtime status of the module you added should be *running*.

    ![View deployed module](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/add-module-3.png)
 
1. In File Explorer, connect to both the Edge local and Edge shares you created previously.

    ![Verify data transform - 1](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/verify-data-2.png) 
 
1. Add data to the local share.

    ![Verify data transform - 2](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/verify-data-3.png) 
 
   The data gets moved to the cloud share.

    ![Verify data transform -3](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/verify-data-4.png)  

   The data is then pushed from the cloud share to the storage account. To view the data, you can use Storage Explorer.

    <!--![Verify data transform](./media/azure-stack-edge-j-series-deploy-configure-compute/verify-data-5.png)-->
 
You have completed the validation process.
