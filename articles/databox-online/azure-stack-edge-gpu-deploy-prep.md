You can now begin to gather information regarding the software configuration for your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device.

## Deployment configuration checklist

Before you deploy your device, you need to collect information to configure the software on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. Preparing some of this information ahead of time helps streamline the process of deploying the device in your environment. Use the [Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU deployment configuration checklist](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-checklist.md) to note down the configuration details as you deploy your device.


## Prerequisites

Following are the configuration prerequisites for your Azure Stack Edge resource, your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device, and the datacenter network.

### For the Azure Stack Edge resource

Before you begin, make sure that:

- Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/). Pay-as-you-go subscriptions aren't supported. To identify the type of Azure subscription you have, see [What is an Azure offer?](../cost-management-billing/manage/switch-azure-offer.md#what-is-an-azure-offer).
- You have owner or contributor access at resource group level for the Azure Stack Edge, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources.

    - To create any Azure Stack Edge resource, you should have permissions as a contributor (or higher) scoped at resource group level. 
    - You also need to make sure that the `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge` and `Microsoft.KeyVault` resource providers are registered. To create any IoT Hub resource, `Microsoft.Devices` provider should be registered. 
        - To register a resource provider, in the Azure portal, go to **Home > Subscriptions > Your-subscription > Resource providers**. 
        - Search for the specific resource provider, for example, `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge`, and register the resource provider. 
    - To create a Storage account resource, again you need contributor or higher access scoped at the resource group level. Azure Storage is by default a registered resource provider.
- To create an order in the Azure Edge Hardware Center, you need to make sure that the `Microsoft.EdgeOrder` provider is registered. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).
- You have admin or user access to Azure AD Graph API for generating activation key or credential operations such as share creation that uses a storage account. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Graph API](/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-permission-scopes#default-access-for-administrators-users-and-guest-users-).

### For the Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device

Before you deploy a physical device, make sure that:

- You've [run the Azure Stack Network Readiness Checker tool](azure-stack-edge-deploy-check-network-readiness.md) to check network readiness for your Azure Stack Edge device. You can use the tool to check whether your firewall rules are blocking access to any essential URLs for the service and verify custom URLs, among other tests. For more information, see [Check network readiness for your Azure Stack Edge device](azure-stack-edge-deploy-check-network-readiness.md).
- You've reviewed the safety information that was included in the shipment package.
- To rackmount the device in a standard 19* rack in your datacenter, make sure to have:

    - A 1U slot available when deploying a single node device. 
    - Two 1U slots available when deploying a two-node cluster.
- You have access to a flat, stable, and level work surface where the device can rest safely.
- The site where you intend to set up the device has standard AC power from an independent source or a rack power distribution unit (PDU) with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
- You have access to your device.


### For the datacenter network

Before you begin, make sure that:

- The network in your datacenter is configured per the networking requirements for your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. For more information, see [Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU System Requirements](azure-stack-edge-system-requirements.md).

- For normal operating conditions of your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU, you have:

    - A minimum of 10-Mbps download bandwidth to ensure the device stays updated.
    - A minimum of 20-Mbps dedicated upload and download bandwidth to transfer files.
    - A minimum of 100-Mbps is required for the internet connection on AP5GC networks.

## Create a new resource

<!--If you have an existing Azure Stack Edge resource to manage your physical device, skip this step and go to [Get the activation key](#get-the-activation-key).-->
In this step, you’ll first order a device and then create a management resource to manage the device with the service in the cloud.

### Create an order resource

To order a device, use the Azure Edge Hardware Center. [Azure Edge Hardware Center](../azure-edge-hardware-center/azure-edge-hardware-center-overview.md) lets you explore and order a variety of hardware from the Azure hybrid portfolio including Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU devices. 

If you have an existing device, skip this step and [Create a management resource for your device](#create-a-management-resource-for-each-device).

When you place an order through the Edge Hardware Center, you can order multiple devices, to be shipped to more than one address, and you can reuse ship to addresses from other orders.

Ordering through Edge Hardware Center will create an Azure resource that will contain all your order-related information. One resource each will be created for each of the units ordered. You’ll have to create an Azure Stack Edge resource after you receive the device to activate and manage the devices.

[!INCLUDE [Create order in Azure Edge Hardware Center](../../includes/azure-edge-hardware-center-new-order.md)]

### Create a management resource for each device

[!INCLUDE [Create management resource](../../includes/azure-edge-hardware-center-create-management-resource.md)]



## Get the activation key

After the Azure Stack Edge resource is up and running, you'll need to get the activation key. This key is used to activate and connect your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device with the resource. You can get this key now while you are in the Azure portal.

1. Select the resource you created, and select **Overview**.

2. In the right pane, enter a name for the Azure Key Vault or accept the default name. The key vault name can be between 3 and 24 characters.

   A key vault is created for each Azure Stack Edge resource that is activated with your device. The key vault lets you store and access secrets, for example, the Channel Integrity Key (CIK) for the service is stored in the key vault. 

   Once you've specified a key vault name, select **Generate key** to create an activation key. 

   ![Screenshot of the Overview pane for a newly created Azure Stack Edge resource. The Generate Activation Key button is highlighted.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-prep/azure-stack-edge-resource-3.png)

   Wait a few minutes while the key vault and activation key are created. Select the copy icon to copy the key and save it for later use.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The activation key expires three days after it is generated.
> - If the key has expired, generate a new key. The older key is not valid.
