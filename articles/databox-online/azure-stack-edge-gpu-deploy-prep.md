## Deployment configuration checklist

Before you deploy your device, you need to collect information to configure the software on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device. Preparing some of this information ahead of time helps streamline the process of deploying the device in your environment. Use the [Azure Stack Edge Pro deployment configuration checklist](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-checklist.md) to note down the configuration details as you deploy your device.


## Prerequisites

Following are the configuration prerequisites for your Azure Stack Edge resource, your Azure Stack Edge Pro device, and the datacenter network.

### For the Azure Stack Edge resource

Before you begin, make sure that:

- Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/). Pay-as-you-go subscriptions aren't supported. To identify the type of Azure subscription you have, see [What is an Azure offer?](../cost-management-billing/manage/switch-azure-offer.md#what-is-an-azure-offer).
- You have owner or contributor access at resource group level for the Azure Stack Edge Pro/Data Box Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources.

    - To create any Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway resource, you should have permissions as a contributor (or higher) scoped at resource group level. 
    - You also need to make sure that the `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge` and `MicrosoftKeyVault` resource providers are registered. To create any IoT Hub resource, `Microsoft.Devices` provider should be registered. 
        - To register a resource provider, in the Azure portal, go to **Home > Subscriptions > Your-subscription > Resource providers**. 
        - Search for the specific resource provider, for example, `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge`, and register the resource provider. 
    - To create a Storage account resource, again you need contributor or higher access scoped at the resource group level. Azure Storage is by default a registered resource provider.
- You have admin or user access to Azure Active Directory Graph API for generating activation key or credential operations such as share creation that uses a storage account. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Graph API](/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-permission-scopes#default-access-for-administrators-users-and-guest-users-).


### For the Azure Stack Edge Pro device

Before you deploy a physical device, make sure that:

- You've reviewed the safety information that was included in the shipment package.
- You have a 1U slot available in a standard 19" rack in your datacenter for rack mounting the device.
- You have access to a flat, stable, and level work surface where the device can rest safely.
- The site where you intend to set up the device has standard AC power from an independent source or a rack power distribution unit (PDU) with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
- You have access to a physical device.


### For the datacenter network

Before you begin, make sure that:

- The network in your datacenter is configured per the networking requirements for your Azure Stack Edge Pro device. For more information, see [Azure Stack Edge Pro System Requirements](azure-stack-edge-system-requirements.md).

- For normal operating conditions of your Azure Stack Edge Pro, you have:

    - A minimum of 10-Mbps download bandwidth to ensure the device stays updated.
    - A minimum of 20-Mbps dedicated upload and download bandwidth to transfer files.

## Create a new resource

If you have an existing Azure Stack Edge resource to manage your physical device, skip this step and go to [Get the activation key](#get-the-activation-key).

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To create an Azure Stack Edge resource, take the following steps in the Azure portal.

1. Use your Microsoft Azure credentials to sign in to the Azure portal at this URL: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the left-pane, select **+ Create a resource**. Search for and select **Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway**. Select **Create**. 

3. Pick the subscription that you want to use for the Azure Stack Edge Pro device. Select the country to where you want to ship this physical device. Select **Show devices**.

9. Select **Next: Tags**. Optionally provide tags to categorize resources and consolidate billing. Select **Next: Review + create**.

10. On the **Review + create** tab, review the **Pricing details**, **Terms of use**, and the details for your resource. Select the combo box for **I have reviewed the privacy terms**.

    ![Create a resource 8](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-prep/create-resource-8.png) 

    You are also notified that during the resource creation, a Managed Service Identity (MSI) is enabled that lets you authenticate to cloud services. This identity exists for as long as the resource exists.

11. Select **Create**.

    The resource creation takes a few minutes. An MSI is also created that lets the Azure Stack Edge device communicate with the resource provider in Azure.

    After the resource is successfully created and deployed, you're notified. Select **Go to resource**.

    ![Go to the Azure Stack Edge Pro resource](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-prep/azure-stack-edge-resource-1.png)

After the order is placed, Microsoft reviews the order and contacts you (via email) with shipping details.

<!--![Notification for review of the Azure Stack Edge Pro order](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-prep/azure-stack-edge-resource-2.png)-->

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to create multiple orders at one time or clone an existing order, you can use the [scripts in Azure Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-stack-edge-order). For more information, see the README file.

If you run into any issues during the order process, see [Troubleshoot order issues](azure-stack-edge-troubleshoot-ordering.md).

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

If necessary, prepare your environment for Azure CLI.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

To create an Azure Stack Edge resource, run the following commands in Azure CLI.

1. Create a resource group by using the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) command, or use an existing resource group:

   ```azurecli
   az group create --name myasepgpu1 --location eastus
   ```

1. To create a device, use the [az databoxedge device create](/cli/azure/databoxedge/device#az_databoxedge_device_create) command:

   ```azurecli
   az databoxedge device create --resource-group myasepgpu1 \
      --device-name myasegpu1 --location eastus --sku EdgeP_Base
   ```

   Choose a location closest to the geographical region where you want to deploy your device. The region stores only the metadata for device management. The actual data can be stored in any storage account.

   For a list of all the regions where the Azure Stack Edge resource is available, see [Azure products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=databox&regions=all). If using Azure Government, all the government regions are available as shown in the [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/regions/).

1. To create an order, run the [az databoxedge order create](/cli/azure/databoxedge/order#az_databoxedge_order_create) command:

   ```azurecli 
   az databoxedge order create --resource-group myasepgpu1 \
      --device-name myasegpu1 --company-name "Contoso" \
      --address-line1 "1020 Enterprise Way" --city "Sunnyvale" \
      --state "California" --country "United States" --postal-code 94089 \
      --contact-person "Gus Poland" --email-list gus@contoso.com --phone 4085555555
   ```

The resource creation takes a few minutes. Run the [az databoxedge order show](/cli/azure/databoxedge/order#az_databoxedge_order_show) command to see the order:

```azurecli
az databoxedge order show --resource-group myasepgpu1 --device-name myasegpu1 
```

After you place an order, Microsoft reviews the order and contacts you by email with shipping details.

## Get the activation key

After the Azure Stack Edge resource is up and running, you'll need to get the activation key. This key is used to activate and connect your Azure Stack Edge Pro device with the resource. You can get this key now while you are in the Azure portal.

1. Select the resource you created, and select **Overview**.

2. In the right pane, enter a name for the Azure Key Vault or accept the default name. The key vault name can be between 3 and 24 characters.

   A key vault is created for each Azure Stack Edge resource that is activated with your device. The key vault lets you store and access secrets, for example, the Channel Integrity Key (CIK) for the service is stored in the key vault. 

   Once you've specified a key vault name, select **Generate key** to create an activation key. 

   ![Get activation key](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-prep/azure-stack-edge-resource-3.png)

   Wait a few minutes while the key vault and activation key are created. Select the copy icon to copy the key and save it for later use.<!--Verify that the new screen has a copy icon.-->


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The activation key expires three days after it is generated.
> - If the key has expired, generate a new key. The older key is not valid.
