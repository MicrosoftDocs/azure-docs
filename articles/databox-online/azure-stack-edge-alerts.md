# Review alerts on Azure Stack Edge

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

This article describes how to view alerts and interpret alert severity for events on your Azure Stack Edge devices. The alerts generate notifications in the Azure portal. The article includes a quick-reference for Azure Stack Edge alerts.

## Overview

The Alerts blade for an Azure Stack Edge device lets you review Azure Stack Edge device–related alerts in real-time. From this blade, you can centrally monitor the health issues of your Azure Stack Edge devices and the overall Microsoft Azure Stack Edge solution.

The initial display is a high-level summary of alerts at each severity level. You can drill down to see individual alerts at each severity level.

[![Screenshot of the Alerts blade for an Azure Stack Edge device in the Azure portal. Alert details are overlaid. The Alerts menu item is highlighted.](media/azure-stack-edge-alerts/azure-stack-edge-alerts-summary-and-detail.png)](media/azure-stack-edge-alerts/azure-stack-edge-alerts-summary-and-detail.png#lightbox)


### Alert severity levels

Alerts have different severity levels, depending on the impact of the alert situation and the need for a response to the alert. The severity levels are:

- **Critical** – This alert is in response to a condition that is affecting the successful performance of your system. Action is required to ensure that Azure Stack Edge service isn't interrupted.
- **Warning** – This condition could become critical if not resolved. You should investigate the situation and take any action required to resolve the issue.
- **Informational** – This alert contains information that can be useful in tracking and managing your system.

### Configure alert notifications

You can also send alert notifications by email for events on your Azure Stack Edge devices. To manage these alert notifications, you create action rules. The action rules can trigger or suppress alert notifications for device events within a resource group, an Azure subscription, or on a device. For more information, see [Using action rules to manage alert notifications](azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-device-event-alert-notifications.md).

## Alerts quick-reference

The following tables list some of the Azure Stack Edge alerts that you might run across, with descriptions and recommended actions. The alerts are grouped in the following categories:

* [Cloud connectivity alerts](#cloud-connectivity-alerts)
* [Edge compute alerts](#edge-compute-alerts)
* [Local Azure Resource Manager alerts](#local-azure-resource-manager-arm-alerts)
* [Performance alerts](#performance-alerts)
* [Storage alerts](#storage-alerts)
* [Security alerts](#security-alerts)
* [Key vault alerts](#key-vault-alerts)
* [Hardware alerts](#hardware-alerts)
* [Update alerts](#update-alerts)
* [Virtual machine alerts](#virtual-machine-alerts)

> [!NOTE]
> In the alerts tables below, some alerts are triggered by more than one event type. If the events have different recommended actions, the table has an alert entry for each of the events.

## Cloud connectivity alerts

The following alerts are raised by a failed connection to an Azure Stack Edge device or when no heartbeat is detected.

| Alert text                       | Severity | Description / Recommended action |
