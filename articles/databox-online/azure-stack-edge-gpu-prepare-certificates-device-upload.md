# Prepare certificates to upload on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

This article describes how to convert the certificates into appropriate format for upload on your Azure Stack Edge device. This procedure is typically required when you bring your own certificates.

To know more about how to create these certificates, see [Create certificates using Azure PowerShell](azure-stack-edge-gpu-create-certificates-powershell.md).


## Prepare certificates

If you bring your own certificates, then the certificates that you created for your device by default reside in the **Personal store** on your client. These certificates need to be exported on your client into appropriate format files that can then be uploaded to your device.

- **Prepare root certificates**: The root certificate must be exported as DER format with `.cer` extension. For detailed steps, see [Export certificates as DER format](#export-certificates-as-der-format).

- **Prepare endpoint certificates**: The endpoint certificates must be exported as *.pfx* files with private keys. For detailed steps, see [Export certificates as *.pfx* file with private keys](#export-certificates-as-pfx-format-with-private-key). 


## Export certificates as DER format

1. Run *certlm.msc* to launch the local machine certificate store.

2. In the Personal certificate store, select the root certificate. Right-click and select **All Tasks > Export...**

3. The certificate wizard opens. Select the format **DER encoded binary X.509 (.cer)**. Select **Next**.

4. Browse and select the location where you want to export the .cer format file.

5. Select **Finish**.

## Export certificates as .pfx format with private key

Take the following steps to export an SSL certificate with private key on a Windows machine. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Perform these steps on the same machine that you used to create the certificate. 

1. Run *certlm.msc* to launch the local machine certificate store.

2. Double-click on the **Personal** folder, and then on **Certificates**.

3. Right-click on the certificate you would like to back up and choose **All tasks > Export...**.

4. Follow the Certificate Export Wizard to back up your certificate to a .pfx file.

    ![Screenshot of the Welcome page of the Certificate Export Wizard. The Next button is highlighted.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-certificates/export-cert-pfx-3.png)

5. Choose **Yes, export the private key**.

    ![Screenshot of the Export Private Key page of the Certificate Export Wizard. The Export The Private Key option and Next button are highlighted.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-certificates/export-cert-pfx-4.png)

6. Choose **Include all certificates in certificate path if possible**, **Export all extended properties** and **Enable certificate privacy**.

   When you include all certificates in your export, you don't need to add the signing chain separately before adding that certificate when you configure certificates using the local web UI. For more information, see [Bring your own certificates](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-certificates.md#bring-your-own-certificates).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > DO NOT select the **Delete Private Key option if export is successful**.

    ![Screenshot of the Export File Format page of the Certificate Export Wizard. The Personal Information Exchange options and the Next button are highlighted.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-certificates/export-cert-pfx-5.png)

7. Enter a password you will remember. Confirm the password. The password protects the private key.

    ![Screenshot of the Security page of the Certificate Export Wizard with a password entered. The Password and Confirm Password options are highlighted.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-certificates/export-cert-pfx-6.png)

8. Choose to save the file in a set location.

    ![Screenshot of the completion page of the Certificate Export Wizard for a certificate exported in DER format. The Finish button is highlighted.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-certificates/export-cert-pfx-7.png)
  
9. Select **Finish**.

10. You receive a message that the export was successful. Select **OK**.

    ![Screenshot showing the notification for a successful certificate export. The OK button is highlighted.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-certificates/export-cert-pfx-9.png)

The .pfx file backup is now saved in the selected location, and is ready to be moved or stored for safekeeping.
