    After you create the Support ticket, a Support engineer will contact you as soon as possible to proceed with your request.

## Get hardware support

This information only applies to Azure Stack device. The process to report hardware issues is as follows:

1. Open a Support ticket from the Azure portal for a hardware issue. Under **Problem type**, select **Azure Stack Hardware**. Choose the **Problem subtype** as **Hardware failure**.

    After you have created the Support ticket, a Support engineer will contact you as soon as possible to proceed with your request.

2. If Microsoft Support determines that this is a hardware issue, then one of the following actions occurs:

    * A Field Replacement Unit (FRU) for the failed hardware part is sent. Currently, power supply units and solid-state drives are the only supported FRUs.
    * Only FRUs are replaced within the next business day, everything else requires a full system replacement (FSR) to be shipped.

3. If it is determined that a FRU replacement is needed by 1 PM local time (Monday to Friday), an onsite technician is dispatched the next business day to your location to perform a FRU replacement. A full system replacement typically will take much longer because the parts are shipped from our factory and could be subject to transportation and customs delays.

## Manage a support request

After creating a support ticket, you can manage the lifecycle of the ticket from within the portal.

### To manage your support requests

1. To get to the help and support page, navigate to **Browse > Help + support**.

    ![Manage support requests](./media/azure-stack-edge-contact-microsoft-support/data-box-edge-manage-support-request-1.png)

2. A tabular listing of **Recent support requests** is displayed in **Help + support**.

    <!--[Manage support requests](./media/azure-stack-edge-contact-microsoft-support/data-box-edge-support-request-1.png)--> 

3. Select and click a support request. You can view the status and the details for this request. Click **+ New message** if you want to follow up on this request.
