## Install the wall mount

The unit can be mounted either vertically or horizontally (for example, under a desk) onto a wall.

1. Make sure the mounting surface is sturdy enough to support the weight of the rack, plus all of the equipment to be installed into the rack. Fit the rack to the surface to test and ensure proper fit and mark the six mounting points. 

1. Use the provided self-tapping screws (for wood surfaces only) to affix the unit to the mounting surface.

1. Once the rack is properly mounted to the surface, the rack mountable equipment can be installed. Use the supplied square cage nuts to provide the mounting points for the rack mountable equipment, then use the supplied cabinet screws to install the equipment into the rack.
