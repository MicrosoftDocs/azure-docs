## Rack the device

The device must be installed on a standard 19-inch rack. Use the following procedure to rack mount your device on a standard 19-inch rack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Stack Edge Pro devices must be rack-mounted for proper operation.


### Prerequisites

- Before you begin, read the safety instructions in your Safety, Environmental, and Regulatory Information booklet. This booklet was shipped with the device.
- Begin installing the rails in the allotted space that is closest to the bottom of the rack enclosure.
- For the tooled rail mounting configuration:
    -  You need to supply eight screws: #10-32, #12-24, #M5, or #M6. The head diameter of the screws must be less than 10 mm (0.4").
    -  You need a flat-tipped screwdriver.

### Identify the rail kit contents

Locate the components for installing the rail kit assembly:
- Two A7 Dell ReadyRails II sliding rail assemblies
- Two hook and loop straps

    ![Identify rail kit contents](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-install/identify-rail-kit-contents.png)

### Install and remove tool-less rails (Square hole or round hole racks)

> [!TIP]
> This option is tool-less because it does not require tools to install and remove the rails into the unthreaded square or round holes in the racks.

1. Position the left and right rail end pieces labeled **FRONT** facing inward and orient each end piece to seat in the holes on the front side of the vertical rack flanges.
2. Align each end piece in the bottom and top holes of the desired U spaces.
3. Engage the back end of the rail until it fully seats on the vertical rack flange and the latch clicks into place. Repeat these steps to position and seat the front-end piece on the vertical rack flange.
4. To remove the rails, pull the latch release button on the end piece midpoint and unseat each rail.

    ![Install and remove tool-less rails](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-install/installing-removing-tool-less-rails.png)

### Install and remove tooled rails (Threaded hole racks)

> [!TIP]
> This option is tooled because it requires a tool (_a flat-tipped screwdriver_) to install and remove the rails into the threaded round holes in the racks.

1. Remove the pins from the front and rear mounting brackets using a flat-tipped screwdriver.
2. Pull and rotate the rail latch subassemblies to remove them from the mounting brackets.
3. Attach the left and right mounting rails to the front vertical rack flanges using two pairs of screws.
4. Slide the left and right back brackets forward against the rear vertical rack flanges and attach them using two pairs of screws.

    ![Install and remove tooled rails 2](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-install/installing-removing-tooled-rails.png)

### Install the system in a rack

1. Pull the inner slide rails out of the rack until they lock into place.
2. Locate the rear rail standoff on each side of the system and lower them into the rear J-slots on the slide assemblies. Rotate the system downward until all the rail standoffs are seated in the J-slots.
3. Push the system inward until the lock levers click into place.
4. Press the slide-release lock buttons on both rails and slide the system into the rack.

    ![Install system in a rack](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-install/installing-system-rack.png)

### Remove the system from the rack

1. Locate the lock levers on the sides of the inner rails.
2. Unlock each lever by rotating it up to its release position.
3. Grasp the sides of the system firmly and pull it forward until the rail standoffs are at the front of the J-slots. Lift the system up and away from the rack and place it on a level surface.

    ![Remove system from the rack](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-install/removing-system-rack.png)

### Engage and release the slam latch

> [!NOTE]
> For systems not equipped with slam latches, secure the system using screws, as described in step 3 of this procedure.

1. Facing the front, locate the slam latch on either side of the system.
2. The latches engage automatically as the system is pushed into the rack and are released by pulling up on the latches.
3. To secure the system for shipment in the rack or for other unstable environments, locate the hard-mount screw under each latch and tighten each screw with a #2 Phillips screwdriver.

## Cable the device

Route the cables and then cable your device. The following procedures explain how to cable your Azure Stack Edge Pro device for power and network.

### Cabling checklist

::: zone pivot="single-node"

Before you start cabling your device, you need the following things:

- Your Azure Stack Edge Pro physical device, unpacked, and rack mounted.
- Two power cables.
- At least one 1-GbE RJ-45 network cable to connect to the management interface. There are two 1-GbE network interfaces, one management and one data, on the device.
- One 25/10-GbE SFP+ copper cable for each data network interface to be configured. At least one data network interface from among PORT 2, PORT 3, PORT 4, PORT 5, or PORT 6 needs to be connected to the Internet (with connectivity to Azure).  
- Access to two power distribution units (recommended).
- At least one 1-GbE network switch to connect a 1-GbE network interface to the Internet for data. The local web UI won't be accessible if the connected switch isn't at least 1 GbE. If using 25/10-GbE interface for data, you'll need a 25-GbE or 10-GbE switch.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you are connecting only one data network interface, we recommend that you use a 25/10-GbE network interface such as PORT 3, PORT 4, PORT 5, or PORT 6 to send data to Azure. 
> - For best performance and to handle large volumes of data, consider connecting all the data ports.
> - The Azure Stack Edge Pro device should be connected to the datacenter network so that it can ingest data from data source servers.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="two-node"

Before you start cabling your device, you need the following things:

- Both of your Azure Stack Edge physical devices, unpacked, and rack mounted.
- Four power cables, two for each device node. <!-- check w/ PIT team around how the bezel is shipped or attached to the device -->
- At least two 1-GbE RJ-45 network cables to connect Port 1 on each device node for initial configuration. <!-- check with Ernie if is clustered in the factory, only 1 node may be connected to mgmt -->
