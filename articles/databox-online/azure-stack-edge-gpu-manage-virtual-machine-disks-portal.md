# Use the Azure portal to manage disks on the VMs on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

You can provision disks on the virtual machines (VMs) deployed on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device using the Azure portal. The disks are provisioned on the device via the local Azure Resource Manager and consume the device capacity. The operations such as adding, detaching, and deleting a disk can be done via the Azure portal, which in turn makes calls to the local Azure Resource Manager to provision the storage. 

This article explains how to add, detach or remove, and delete data disks from an existing VM, and resize the VM itself via, the Azure portal.

        
## About disks on VMs

Your VM can have an OS disk and a data disk. Every virtual machine deployed on your device has one attached operating system disk. This OS disk has a pre-installed OS, which was selected when the VM was created. This disk contains the boot volume.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change the OS disk size for a VM deployed on your device. The OS disk size is determined by the VM size that you selected.

A data disk on the other hand, is a managed disk attached to the VM running on your device. A data disk is used to store application data. Data disks are typically SCSI drives. The size of the VM determines how many data disks you can attach to a VM. By default, premium storage is used to host the disks.

A VM deployed on your device may sometimes contain a temporary disk. The temporary disk provides short-term storage for applications and processes, and is intended to only store data such as page or swap files. Data on the temporary disk may be lost during a maintenance event or when you redeploy a VM. During a successful standard reboot of the VM, data on the temporary disk will persist. 


## Prerequisites

Before you begin to manage disks on the VMs running on your device via the Azure portal, make sure that:


1. You've access to an activated Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. You have also enabled a network interface for compute on your device. This action creates a virtual switch on that network interface on your VM. 
    1. In the local UI of your device, go to **Compute**. Select the network interface that you will use to create a virtual switch.

        > [!IMPORTANT] 
        > You can only configure one port for compute.

    1. Enable compute on the network interface. Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU creates and manages a virtual switch corresponding to that network interface.

1. You have at least one VM deployed on your device. To create this VM, see the instructions in [Deploy VM on your Azure Stack Edge Pro via the Azure portal](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-portal.md).


## Add a data disk

Follow these steps to add a disk to a virtual machine deployed on your device.

1. Go to the virtual machine to which you want to add a data disk, and select **Disks** in the virtual machine **Details**.
    
    ![Screenshot of Disks settings on the Details tab of an Azure Stack Edge virtual machine. The Disks label is highlighted.](./media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-virtual-machine-disks-portal/add-data-disk-1.png)

1. In the **Disks** blade, under **Data Disks**, select **Create and attach a new disk**.

    ![Screenshot of the Disks blade in Overview view for Virtual Machines. The Create and attach a new disk option, under Data disks, is highlighted.](./media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-virtual-machine-disks-portal/add-data-disk-2.png)

1. In the **Create a new disk** blade, enter the following parameters:

    
    |Field  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Name     | A unique name within the resource group. The name cannot be changed after the data disk is created.     |
    |Edge resource group |Enter the Edge resource group in which to store the new disk.|
    |Size| The size of your data disk in GiB. The maximum size of a data disk is determined by the VM size that you have selected. When provisioning a disk, you should also consider the actual space on your device and other VM workloads that are running that consume capacity.  |         

    ![Screenshot of the Create a new disk blade for a virtual machine. The OK button is highlighted.](./media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-virtual-machine-disks-portal/add-data-disk-3.png)

    Select **OK** and proceed.

1. In the **Disks** display, you'll see an entry corresponding to the new disk. Accept the default or assign a valid Logical Unit Number (LUN) to the disk, and select **Save**. A LUN is a unique identifier for a SCSI disk. For more information, see [What is a LUN?](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/azure-to-guest-disk-mapping#what-is-a-lun).
