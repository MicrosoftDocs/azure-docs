![Safety warning](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)![Electric shock hazard 2](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png)![Moving parts hazard 2](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-moving-parts-hazard.png)**WARNING:**
* To reduce the risk of electrical shock, injury from moving parts, damage, or loss of data, always make sure to disconnect the equipment from the AC electrical source when working inside the equipment. Powering down the system doesn’t ensure there’s no electrical activity inside the equipment.


### Electrostatic precautions

![Safety notice](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-notice.png)**NOTICE:**
* Electrostatic discharge (ESD) and ESD protection: ESD can damage drives, boards, and other parts. We recommend that you perform all procedures in this chapter only at an ESD work- station. If one isn’t available, provide some ESD protection by wearing an antistatic wrist strap attached to chassis ground any unpainted metal surface on the equipment when handling parts.
* ESD and handling boards: Always handle boards carefully. They can be extremely sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Hold boards only by their edges. After removing a board from its protective wrapper or from the equipment, place the board component side up on a grounded, static-free surface. Use a conductive foam pad if available but not the board wrapper. Don’t slide board over any surface.
* Wear a grounded wrist strap. If none are available, discharge any personal static electricity by touching the bare metal chassis of the server, or the bare metal body of any other grounded device.
* Humid environments tend to have less static electricity than dry environments. A grounding strap is warranted whenever danger of static electricity exists.

![Safety notice](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-notice.png)**NOTICE:**
* Leave all replacement components inside their static-proof packaging until you’re ready to use them.
