[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

This article provides steps to reset an Azure Stack Edge device. The reset operation generates a Secure Erase Certificate that verifies details about your device in an erase record. You can also manually generate a Secure Erase Certificate.

The Secure Erase Certificate includes software version details about the device and disk-by-disk details including data erasure type, data erasure method, and erasure verification method. 
 
The following erase types are supported:

|Data erasure type |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|CryptoErase  |Sanitizes the encryption key, leaving the data on disk unrecoverable.  |
|BlockErase  |Deletes all user data from the disk.  |
|CryptoAndBlockErase  |Performs a crypto erase followed by a block erase.  |
