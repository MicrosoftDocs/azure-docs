          You're responsible for fixing issues in the applications that you deploy on the Azure Stack Edge platform, even if you're consuming services like Kubernetes that are provided by the platform. To create a support ticket with Microsoft, see the section below to [open a support ticket](#how-do-i-open-a-support-ticket-with-microsoft-).

      - question: |
          How do I replace an Azure Stack Edge device if there's a hardware failure?
        answer: |
          If Microsoft determines the device is faulty, Microsoft will arrange for replacement and delivery of devices. If you [Return your Azure Stack Edge device](azure-stack-edge-return-device.md?tabs=azure-edge-hardware-center), Microsoft will process the return of your device.
          
      - question: |
          How do I open a support ticket with Microsoft?
        answer: |
          For issues that you can't address in-house, [open a support ticket](azure-stack-edge-contact-microsoft-support.md), and Microsoft will assess your questions.

          - For Azure Stack Edge and Azure Data Box Gateway issues like network interfaces, disk drives, or firmware, the ticket is assigned to Microsoft Support.
          - If the device is faulty, damaged, or lost, and loss isn't the customer's fault, Microsoft may:
            - Send a field support person to address the issue, or 
            - Replace the device. For more information, see the frequently asked questions section on the [Azure Stack Edge pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-stack/edge/).
          - If you have a software issue with your Kubernetes service that you can't fix yourself, or if you have a virtual machine management question that isn't already documented, the Microsoft support team may consult with you to triage the issue and debug it remotely.
          - To address software issues in the Azure Stack Edge platform or services that run on it, Microsoft may work with you directly to provide a workaround or a fix available via a software update.
          - For information about software updates for your device, see [Update your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU](./azure-stack-edge-gpu-install-update.md?tabs=version-2106-and-later).
