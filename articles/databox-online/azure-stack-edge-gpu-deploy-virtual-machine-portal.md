# Deploy VMs on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device via the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

You can create and manage virtual machines (VMs) on an Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device by using the Azure portal, templates, and Azure PowerShell cmdlets, and via the Azure CLI or Python scripts. This article describes how to create and manage a VM on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device by using the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You will need to enable multifactor authentication for the user who manages the VMs and images that are deployed on your device from the cloud. The cloud operations will fail if the user doesn't have multifactor authentication enabled. For steps to enable multifactor authentication, see [Enable Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication](/training/modules/secure-aad-users-with-mfa/4-exercise-mfa).

## VM deployment workflow

The high-level summary of the deployment workflow is as follows:

1. Enable a network interface for compute on your Azure Stack Edge device. This step creates a virtual switch on the specified network interface.
1. Enable cloud management of VMs from the Azure portal.
1. Upload a VHD to an Azure Storage account by using Azure Storage Explorer. 
1. Use the uploaded VHD to download the VHD onto the device, and create a VM image from the VHD. 
1. Use the resources created in the previous steps:
    1. VM image that you created.
    1. Virtual switch associated with the network interface on which you enabled compute.
    1. Subnet associated with the virtual switch.

    And create or specify the following resources inline:
    1. VM name, choose a supported VM size, sign-in credentials for the VM. 
    1. Create new data disks or attach existing data disks.
    1. Configure static or dynamic IP for the VM. If you're providing a static IP, choose from a free IP in the subnet range of the network interface enabled for compute.

    Use the preceding resources to create a VM.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin to create and manage VMs on your device via the Azure portal, make sure that:

1. You've completed the network settings on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device as described in [Step 1: Configure an Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device](./azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md#step-1-configure-azure-stack-edge-device).

    1. You've enabled a network interface for compute. This network interface IP is used to create a virtual switch for the VM deployment. In the local UI of your device, go to **Compute**. Select the network interface that you'll use to create a virtual switch.

        > [!IMPORTANT] 
        > You can configure only one port for compute.

    1. Enable compute on the network interface. Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU creates and manages a virtual switch corresponding to that network interface.

1. You have access to a Windows or Linux VHD that you'll use to create the VM image for the VM you intend to create.

## Deploy a VM

Follow these steps to create a VM on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device.

### Add a VM image

1. Upload a VHD to an Azure Storage account. Follow the steps in [Use Storage Explorer for upload](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-templates.md#use-storage-explorer-for-upload).

   For information about preparing the VHD, see [Prepare a generalized image from a Windows VHD](azure-stack-edge-gpu-prepare-windows-vhd-generalized-image.md).

   [Troubleshoot VM image uploads](azure-stack-edge-gpu-troubleshoot-virtual-machine-image-upload.md).

1. In the Azure portal, go to the Azure Stack Edge resource for your device. Then go to **Edge services** > **Virtual machines**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Overview pane of an Azure Stack Edge device, with the Virtual machines option, under Edge Services, highlighted.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-portal/add-virtual-machine-image-1.png)

1. The first step is to add a VM image. You've already uploaded a VHD into the storage account in the earlier step. You'll use this VHD to create a VM image.

    Select **+ Add image** to download the VHD from the storage account and add it to the device. The download process takes several minutes depending on the size of the VHD and the internet bandwidth available for the download. 

    ![Screenshot of the Overview pane for Virtual Machines, with the Plus Add Image button highlighted.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-portal/add-virtual-machine-image-3.png)

1. On the **Add image** pane, make the following field entries. Then select **Add**.

    |Field  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Download from storage blob    |Browse to the location of the storage blob in the storage account where you uploaded the VHD.         |
    |Download to    | Automatically set to the current device where you're deploying the VM.        |
    |Edge resource group  |Select the resource group to add the image to. |
    |Save image as      | The name for the VM image that you're creating from the VHD you uploaded to the storage account.        |
    |OS type     |Choose from Windows or Linux as the operating system of the VHD you'll use to create the VM image.         |
    |VM generation    |Choose Gen 1 or Gen 2 as the generation of the image you'll use to create the VM. For Gen 2 VMs, secure boot is enabled by default.        |
