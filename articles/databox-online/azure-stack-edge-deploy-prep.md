## Prerequisites

Following are the configuration prerequisites for your Azure Stack Edge resource, your Azure Stack Edge Pro FPGA device, and the datacenter network.

### For the Azure Stack Edge resource

Before you begin, make sure that:

* Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/). Pay-as-you-go subscriptions aren't supported.

* RBAC roles: You have the following role assignments in Azure role-based access control (RBAC):

  * To create Azure Stack Edge, IoT Hub, and Azure storage resources, a user must have the Contributor or Owner role at resource group scope.

  * To assign the Contributor role to a user at resource group scope, you must have the Owner role at subscription scope.

  For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.yml).

* Resource providers: The following resource providers are registered: 

  * To create an Azure Stack Edge/Data Box Gateway resource, make sure the `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge`provider is registered.

  * To create an IoT Hub resource, make sure the `Microsoft.Devices` provider is registered.

  * To create an Azure Storage resource, make sure Azure Storage is registered. The Azure Storage Resource Provider (SRP) is by default a registered resource provider, but in some cases registration may be needed.

  **To register a resource provider, you must have been assigned the related RBAC role, above.**

  For information on how to register, see [Register resource provider](azure-stack-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode.md#register-resource-providers).

* You have admin or user access to Azure AD Graph API. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Graph API](/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-permission-scopes#default-access-for-administrators-users-and-guest-users-).

* You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.

* You are not blocked by any Azure Policy assignment set up by your system administrator. For more information about Azure Policy, see [Quickstart: Create a policy assignment to identify non-compliant resources](../governance/policy/assign-policy-portal.md).


### For the Azure Stack Edge Pro FPGA device

Before you deploy a physical device, make sure that:

* You've reviewed the safety information that was included in the shipment package.
* You have a 1U slot available in a standard 19" rack in your datacenter for rack mounting the device.
* You have access to a flat, stable, and level work surface where the device can rest safely.
* The site where you intend to set up the device has standard AC power from an independent source or a rack power distribution unit (PDU) with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
* You have access to a physical device.

### For the datacenter network

Before you begin, make sure that:

* The network in your datacenter is configured per the networking requirements for your Azure Stack Edge Pro FPGA device. For more information, see [Azure Stack Edge Pro FPGA System Requirements](azure-stack-edge-system-requirements.md).

* For normal operating conditions of your Azure Stack Edge Pro FPGA, you have:

  * A minimum of 10 Mbps download bandwidth to ensure the device stays updated.
  * A minimum of 20 Mbps dedicated upload and download bandwidth to transfer files.

## Create new resource for existing device

If you're an existing Azure Stack Edge Pro FPGA customer, use the following procedure to create a new resource if you need to replace or reset your existing device.

If you're a new customer, we recommend that you explore using Azure Stack Edge Pro - GPU devices for your workloads. For more information, go to [What is Azure Stack Edge Pro with GPU](azure-stack-edge-gpu-overview.md). For information about ordering an Azure Stack Edge Pro with GPU device, go to [Create a new resource for Azure Stack Edge Pro - GPU](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-prep.md#create-a-new-resource).

To create a new Azure Stack Edge resource for an existing device, take the following steps in the Azure portal.

1. Use your Microsoft Azure credentials to sign in to:

    - The Azure portal at this URL: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
    - Or, the Azure Government portal at this URL: [https://portal.azure.us](https://portal.azure.us). For more details, go to [Connect to Azure Government using the portal](../azure-government/documentation-government-get-started-connect-with-portal.md).

1. Select **+ Create a resource**. Search for and select **Azure Stack Edge**. Then select **Create**.
