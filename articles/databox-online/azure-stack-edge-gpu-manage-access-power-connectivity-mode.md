> * Manage device access
> * Enable device access via remote PowerShell over HTTP
> * Enable device access from outside network
> * Manage resource access
> * Manage connectivity mode
> * Manage power


## Manage device access

The access to your Azure Stack Edge Pro device is controlled by the use of a device password. You can change the password via the local web UI. You can also reset the device password in the Azure portal.

The access to data on the device disks is also controlled by encryption-at-rest keys. 

You can access the device by opening a remote PowerShell session over HTTP or HTTPS from the local web UI of the device.

### Change device password

Follow these steps in the local UI to change the device password.

1. In the local web UI, go to **Maintenance > Password**.
2. Enter the current password and then the new password. The supplied password must be between 8 and 16 characters. The password must have 3 of the following characters: uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters. Confirm the new password.

3. Select **Change password**.
 
### Reset device password

The reset workflow does not require the user to recall the old password and is useful when the password is lost. This workflow is performed in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Overview > Reset admin password**.

### Manage access to device data

For the Azure Stack Edge Pro R and Azure Stack Edge Mini R devices, the access to device data is controlled by using encryption-at-rest keys for the device drives. After you have successfully configured the device for encryption-at-rest, the rotate encryption-at-rest keys option becomes available in the local UI of the device. 

This operation lets you change the keys for BitLocker volumes `HcsData` and `HcsInternal` and all the self-encrypting drives on your device.

Follow these steps to rotate the encryption-at-rest keys.

1. In the local UI of the device, go to the **Get started** page. On the **Security** tile, select **Encryption-at-rest: Rotate keys** option. This option is only available after you have successfully configured the encryption-at-rest keys.

    ![Select Rotate keys for Encryption-at-rest in the Get started page](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode/rotate-encryption-keys-1.png)

1. You can use your own BitLocker keys or use the system-generated keys.  

    To provide your own key, enter a 32 character long Base-64 encoded string. The input is similar to what you would provide when you configure the encryption-at-rest for the first time.

    ![Bring your own encryption-at-rest key](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode/rotate-encryption-keys-2.png)

    You can also choose to use a system generated key.

    ![Use system-generated Encryption-at-rest key](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode/rotate-encryption-keys-3.png)

1. Select **Apply**. The key protectors are rotated.

    ![Apply the new encryption-at-rest key](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode/rotate-encryption-keys-4.png)

1. When prompted to download and save the key file, select **Download and continue**. 

    ![Download and continue the key file](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode/rotate-encryption-keys-5.png)

    Save the `.json` key file in a secure location. This file is used to facilitate a potential future recovery of the device.

## Enable device access via remote PowerShell over HTTP

You can open a remote PowerShell session to your device over HTTP or HTTPS. By default, you access the device via a PowerShell session over HTTPS. However, in trusted networks, it is acceptable to enable remote PowerShell over HTTP.

Follow these steps in the local UI to enable remote PowerShell over HTTP:

1. In the local UI of your device, go to **Settings** from the top right corner of the page.
1. Select **Enable** to allow you to open a remote PowerShell session for your device over HTTP. This setting should be enabled only in trusted networks.

    ![Screenshot shows Enable remote PowerShell over HTTP setting.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode/enable-remote-powershell-http-1.png)

1. Select **Apply**.

You can now connect to the PowerShell interface of the device over HTTP. For details, see [Connect to the PowerShell interface of your device](azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-powershell-interface.md#connect-to-the-powershell-interface).

## Enable device access from outside network

To be able to connect to your Azure Stack Edge device from an outside network, make sure the network for your laptop and the network for the device meet the following requirements.

| Traffic direction  | Out-of-network requirements |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Outbound to laptop |On the network for the Azure Stack Edge device:<ul><li>Configure the correct gateways on the device to enable traffic to reach the laptopâ€™s network.</li><li>If you configure multiple gateways on the device, ensure that traffic can reach your laptop's network on all gateways.<br>A device ideally tries to use the network interface card (NIC) with the lowest route metric. However, there's no clear way for an Azure Stack Edge device to identify the NIC with the lowest metric. So it's best to make your laptop network reachable on all configured gateways.</li></ul>|
|Inbound to device   |On the network for your laptop:<ul><li>Configure a clear network route from the laptop to the network for the device, possibly through defined gateways.</li></ul>|

> [!NOTE]
> Diagnostic tests for Azure Stack Edge return a warning if all gateways don't have internet connectivity. For diagnostics information, see [Run diagnostics](azure-stack-edge-gpu-troubleshoot.md#run-diagnostics).

<!--ORIGINAL PRESENTATION: If a user needs to be able to connect to the Azure Stack Edge appliance from an outside network, you'll need this network configuration:

- **In-bound traffic:** For in-bound traffic from the customer's laptop (in network A) to the appliance (in network B), network A should have a clear route to network B, possibly through defined gateways.

- **Outbound traffic:** For outbound traffic from the appliance to the customer's laptop (network B to network A):

  - Configure the correct gateways on the appliance so that traffic can reach network A.

  - If you configure multiple gateways on the appliance, ensure that traffic can reach network B on all gateways.

    An appliance ideally tries to use the network interface card (NIC) with the lowest route metric. However, there's no clear way for an Azure Stack Edge appliance to identify the NIC with the lowest metric. So it's best to make network A reachable on all configured gateways.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Diagnostic tests for Azure Stack Edge return a warning if all gateways don't have internet connectivity. For diagnostics information, see [Run diagnostics](azure-stack-edge-gpu-troubleshoot.md#run-diagnostics). Terminology creep: This is the first reference to internet connectivity.-->


## Manage resource access

To create your Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resource, you need permissions as a contributor or higher at a resource group level. You also need the corresponding resource providers to be registered. For any operations that involve activation key and credentials, permissions to the Microsoft Graph API are also required. These requirements are described in the following sections.

### Manage Microsoft Graph API permissions

When generating the activation key for the Azure Stack Edge Pro device, or performing any operations that require credentials, you need permissions to the Microsoft Graph API. The operations that need credentials could be:

-  Creating a share with an associated storage account.
-  Creating a user who can access the shares on the device.

You should have a `User` access on the Microsoft Entra tenant as you need to be able to `Read all directory objects`. You can't be a Guest user as they don't have permissions to `Read all directory objects`. If you're a guest, then the operations such as generation of an activation key, creation of a share on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device, creation of a user, configuration of Edge compute role, reset device password will all fail.

For more information on how to provide access to users to Microsoft Graph API, see [Overview of Microsoft Graph permissions](/graph/permissions-overview).

### Register resource providers

To provision a resource in Azure (in the Azure Resource Manager model), you need a resource provider that supports the creation of that resource. For example, to provision a virtual machine, you should have a 'Microsoft.Compute' resource provider available in the subscription.
 
Resource providers are registered on the level of the subscription. By default, any new Azure subscription is pre-registered with a list of commonly used resource providers. The resource provider for 'Microsoft.DataBoxEdge' is not included in this list.

You don't need to grant access permissions to the subscription level for users to be able to create resources like 'Microsoft.DataBoxEdge' within their resource groups that they have owner rights on, as long as the resource providers for these resources is already registered.

Before you attempt to create any resource, make sure that the resource provider is registered in the subscription. If the resource provider is not registered, you'll need to make sure that the user creating the new resource has enough rights to register the required resource provider on the subscription level. If you haven't done this as well, then you'll see the following error:

*The subscription \<Subscription name> doesn't have permissions to register the resource provider(s): Microsoft.DataBoxEdge.*


To get a list of registered resource providers in the current subscription, run the following command:

```PowerShell
Get-AzResourceProvider -ListAvailable |where {$_.Registrationstate -eq "Registered"}
```

For Azure Stack Edge Pro device, `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge` should be registered. To register `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge`, subscription admin should run the following command:

```PowerShell
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.DataBoxEdge
```

For more information on how to register a resource provider, see [Resolve errors for resource provider registration](../azure-resource-manager/templates/error-register-resource-provider.md).

## Manage connectivity mode

Apart from the default fully connected mode, your device can also run in partially connected, or fully disconnected mode. Each of these modes is described as below:

- **Fully connected** - This is the normal default mode in which the device operates. Both the cloud upload and download of data is enabled in this mode. You can use the Azure portal or the local web UI to manage the device. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the Network Function Manager deployments, the Azure Stack Edge device must be **Online** and operating in fully connected mode.

- **Partially disconnected** â€“ In this mode, the device cannot upload or download any share data though you can manage the device via the Azure portal.

    This mode is typically used when on a metered satellite network and the goal is to minimize network bandwidth consumption. Minimal network consumption may still occur for device monitoring operations.

- **Disconnected** â€“ In this mode, the device is fully disconnected from the cloud and both the cloud uploads and downloads are disabled. The device can only be managed via the local web UI.

    This mode is typically used when you want to take your device offline.

To change device mode, follow these steps:

1. In the local web UI of your device, go to **Configuration > Cloud**.
2. From the dropdown list, select the mode that you want to operate the device in. You can select from **Fully connected**, **Partially connected**, and **Fully disconnected**. To run the device in partially disconnected mode, enable **Azure portal management**.

 
## Manage power

You can shut down or restart your physical device using the local web UI. We recommend that before you restart, take the shares offline on the data server and then the device. This action minimizes any possibility of data corruption.

1. In the local web UI, go to **Maintenance > Power**.
2. Select **Shutdown** or **Restart** depending on what you intend to do.

    ![Power settings](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode/shut-down-restart-1.png)

3. When prompted for confirmation, select **Yes** to proceed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you shut down the physical device, you will need to push the power button on the device to turn it on.
