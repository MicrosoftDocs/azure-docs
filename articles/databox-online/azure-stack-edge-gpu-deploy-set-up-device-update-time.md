# Tutorial: Configure the device settings for Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU

This tutorial describes how to configure device related settings for your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. You can set up your device name, update server, and time server via the local web UI.

The device settings can take around 5-7 minutes to complete.

In this tutorial, you learn about:

## Prerequisites

Before you configure device related settings on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device GPU, make sure that:

* For your physical device:

    - You've installed the physical device as detailed in [Install Azure Stack Edge Pro](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-install.md).
    - You've configured network and enabled and configured compute network on your device as detailed in [Tutorial: Configure network for Azure Stack Edge Pro with GPU](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-network-compute-web-proxy.md).


## Configure device settings

Follow these steps to configure device related settings:

1. In the local web UI for your device, go to the **Device** page.

1. Enter a **Name** for your device. The name must contain from 1 to 13 characters and can have letter, numbers, and hyphens.

1. Provide a **DNS domain** for your device using all lowercase characters. This domain is used to set up the device as a file server.

1. To validate and apply the configured device settings, select **Apply**.

    When the device name and the DNS domain are changed, the SMB endpoint is created.  

    If you've changed the device name and the DNS domain, the automatically generated self-signed certificates on the device won't work. You'll need to regenerate device certificates or bring your own certificates.

1. After the settings are applied, select **Next: Update server**.

## Configure update

1. On the **Update** page, you can now configure the location from where to download the updates for your device.  

    - You can get the updates directly from the **Microsoft Update server**.

        ![Screenshot of local web U I "Update Server" page.](./media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-set-up-device-update-time/update-2.png)

        You can also choose to deploy updates from the **Windows Server Update services (WSUS)**. Provide the path to the WSUS server.

        > [!NOTE] 
        > If a separate Windows Update server is configured and if you choose to connect over *https* (instead of *http*), then signing chain certificates required to connect to the update server are needed. For information on how to create and upload certificates, go to [Manage certificates](azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-certificates.md). 

1. Select **Apply**.
1. After the update server is configured, select **Next: Time**.

## Configure time

Follow these steps to configure time settings on your device. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Though the time settings are optional, we strongly recommend that you configure a primary NTP and a secondary NTP server on the local network for your device. If local server is not available, public NTP servers can be configured.

NTP servers are required because your device must synchronize time so that it can authenticate with your cloud service providers.

1. On the **Time** page, you can select the time zone, and the primary and secondary NTP servers for your device.  
    
    1. In the **Time zone** drop-down list, select the time zone that corresponds to the geographic location in which the device is being deployed.
        The default time zone for your device is PST. Your device will use this time zone for all scheduled operations.

    2. In the **Primary NTP server** box, enter the primary server for your device or accept the default value of time.windows.com.  
        Ensure that your network allows NTP traffic to pass from your datacenter to the internet.

    3. Optionally, in the **Secondary NTP server** box, enter a secondary server for your device.

    4. To validate and apply the configured time settings, select **Apply**.

1. After the settings are applied, select **Next: Certificates**.
