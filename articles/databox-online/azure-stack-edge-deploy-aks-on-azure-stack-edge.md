This article describes how to deploy and manage Azure Kubernetes service (AKS) on your Azure Stack Edge device. You can also use this article to create persistent volumes, use GitOps to manage an Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, and remove AKS and Azure Arc.

The intended audience for this article is IT administrators who are familiar with setup and deployment of workloads on the Azure Stack Edge device.

## About Azure Kubernetes service on Azure Stack Edge

Azure Stack Edge is an AI-enabled edge computing device with high performance network I/O capabilities. After you configure compute on your Azure Stack Edge device, you can use the Azure portal to deploy Azure Kubernetes service, including infrastructure VMs. The AKS cluster is then used for workload deployment via Azure Arc.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that:

- You have a Microsoft account with credentials to access Azure portal, and access to an Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. The Azure Stack Edge device is configured and activated using instructions in [Set up and activate your device](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-checklist.md).
- You have at least one virtual switch created and enabled for compute on your Azure Stack Edge device. For detailed steps, see [Create virtual switches](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-network-compute-web-proxy.md?pivots=single-node#configure-virtual-switches).
- You have a client to access your device that's running a supported operating system. If using a Windows client, make sure that it's running PowerShell 5.0 or later.
- Before you enable Azure Arc on the Kubernetes cluster, make sure that you’ve enabled and registered `Microsoft.Kubernetes` and `Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration` resource providers against your subscription. For detailed steps, see [Register resource providers via Azure CLI](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/quickstart-connect-cluster?tabs=azure-cli#register-providers-for-azure-arc-enabled-kubernetes).
- If you intend to deploy Azure Arc for Kubernetes cluster, you need to create a resource group. You must have owner level access to the resource group.

  To verify the access level for the resource group, go to **Resource group** > **Access control (IAM)** > **View my access**. Under **Role assignments**, you must be listed as an Owner.

    [![Screenshot showing assignments for the selected user on the Access control (IAM) page in the Azure portal.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-access-control-my-assignments.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-access-control-my-assignments.png#lightbox)

Depending on the workloads you intend to deploy, you may need to ensure the following **optional** steps are also completed:
 
- If you intend to deploy [custom locations](/azure/azure-arc/platform/conceptual-custom-locations) on your Arc-enabled cluster, you need to register the `Microsoft.ExtendedLocation` resource provider against your subscription.
 
  You must fetch the custom location object ID and use it to enable custom locations via the PowerShell interface of your device.

   ```azurepowershell
   az login
   az ad sp show --id bc313c14-387c-4e7d-a58e-70417303ee3b --query id -o tsv
   ```
  
   Here's a sample output using the Azure CLI. You can run the same commands via the Cloud Shell in the Azure portal.

   ```azurepowershell
   PS /home/user> az ad sp show --id bc313c14-388c-4e7d-a58e-70017303ee3b --query id -o tsv
   51dfe1e8-70c6-4de5-a08e-e18aff23d815
   PS /home/user>
   ```

  For more information, see [Create and manage custom locations in Arc-enabled Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/custom-locations).

- If deploying Kubernetes or PMEC workloads:
   - You may have selected a specific workload profile using the local UI or using PowerShell. Detailed steps are documented for the local UI in [Configure compute IPS](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-network-compute-web-proxy.md?pivots=two-node#configure-compute-ips-1) and for PowerShell in [Change Kubernetes workload profiles](azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-powershell-interface.md#change-kubernetes-workload-profiles). 
   - You may need virtual networks that you’ve added using the instructions in [Create virtual networks](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-network-compute-web-proxy.md?pivots=single-node#configure-virtual-network).

- If you're using HPN VMs as your infrastructure VMs, the vCPUs should be automatically reserved. Run the following command to verify the reservation:

     ```azurepowershell
     Get-HcsNumaLpMapping
     ```

- This configuration is applied when you install or update to Azure Stack Edge 2307. There are two scenarios where the configuration won't be applied during update:

    - When you have more minroot vCPUs configured than the four vCPUs from Numa0 + All vCPUs from Numa1. This scenario applies mainly to Azure Stack Edge gateway customers who configure all vCPUs for minroot. For Azure Stack Edge Pro 2, there's only one Numa. For Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 with 40 cores, it's more minroot vCPUs configured than 24 vCPUs, and for Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 with 48 vCPUs it's more than 28 vCPUs configured.

    - When you have HPN VMs deployed and you're consuming more than 16 vCPUs on a machine with 40 cores, or more than 20 vCPUs on a machine with 48 cores for HPN VMs.

## Deploy AKS on Azure Stack Edge

There are multiple steps to deploy AKS on Azure Stack Edge. Some steps are optional, as noted below.
 
## Verify AKS is enabled

To verify that AKS is enabled, go to your Azure Stack Edge resource in the Azure portal. In the **Overview** pane, select the **Azure Kubernetes Service** tile.

   [![Screenshot showing the Azure Kubernetes Service tile in the Overview pane of the Azure portal.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-azure-kubernetes-service-tile.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-azure-kubernetes-service-tile.png#lightbox)

## Set custom locations (optional)

1.	[Connect to the PowerShell interface of the device](azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-powershell-interface.md#connect-to-the-powershell-interface).

1.	Run the following command **as an option** to set custom locations. Input the custom location object ID that you fetched when completing your prerequisites.

    ```azurepowershell
    Set-HcsKubeClusterArcInfo –CustomLocationsObjectId <custom_location_object_id>
    ```
  
    Here's a sample output using the Azure CLI. You can run the same commands via the Cloud Shell in the Azure portal.

    ```azurepowershell
    [1d9nhq2.microsoftdatabox.com]: PS> Set-HcsKubeClusterArcInfo –CustomLocationsObjectId 51dfe1e8-70c6-4de5-a08e-e18aff23d815
    [1d9nhq2.microsoftdatabox.com]: PS>
    ```

## Specify static IP pools (optional)

An **optional** step where you can assign IP pools for the virtual network used by Kubernetes pods.

> [!NOTE]
> SAP customers can skip this step.

You can specify a static IP address pool for each virtual network that is enabled for Kubernetes. The virtual network enabled for Kubernetes generates a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` that's created for the Kubernetes cluster.

During application provisioning, Kubernetes pods can use static IP addresses in the IP pool for container network interfaces, like container single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) interfaces. This can be done by pointing to a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` in the PodSpec.

Use the following steps to assign static IP pools in the local UI of your device.

1. Go to the **Advanced networking** page in Azure portal.

1. If you didn’t create virtual networks earlier, select **Add virtual network** to create a Virtual network. You need to specify the virtual switch associated with the virtual network, VLAN ID, subnet mask, and gateway.

1. In an example shown here, we've configured three virtual networks. In each of these virtual networks, VLAN is **0** and subnet mask and gateway match the external values; for example, **255.255.0.0** and **192.168.0.1**.
   1. **First virtual network** – Name is **N2** and associated with **vswitch-port5**.
   1. **Second virtual network** – Name is **N3** and associated with **vswitch-port5**.
   1. **Third virtual network** – Name is **N6** and associated with **vswitch-port6**.
 
   1. Once all three virtual networks are configured, they are listed under the virtual networks, as follows: 
 
       [![Screenshot that shows the Advanced networking page in the Azure portal.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-advanced-networking.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-advanced-networking.png#lightbox)

1. Assign IP address pools to the virtual networks:

   1. On the **Kubernetes** page, select a virtual network that you created and **enable it for Kubernetes**.
   
   1. Specify a contiguous range of static IPs for Kubernetes pods in the virtual network. In this example, a range of one IP address was provided for each of the three virtual networks that we created.

1. Select **Apply** to apply the changes for all virtual networks. 
 
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't modify the IP pool settings once the AKS cluster is deployed.

    [![Screenshot that shows the Kubernetes page with virtual networks in the Azure portal.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-kubernetes-virtual-networks-2.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-kubernetes-virtual-networks-2.png#lightbox)

## Configure the compute virtual switch

Use this step to configure the virtual switch for Kubernetes compute traffic.

1. In the local UI of your device, go to the **Kubernetes** page.

1. Select **Modify** to configure a virtual switch for Kubernetes compute traffic.

    [![Screenshot that shows the Kubernetes page in the Azure portal.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-kubernetes-page.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-kubernetes-page.png#lightbox)

1. Enable the compute on a port that has internet access. For example, in this case, port 2 that was connected to the internet is enabled for compute. Internet access allows you to retrieve container images from AKS.

   The Azure consistent services virtual IP must be able to reach this compute virtual switch network either via external routing or by creating an Azure consistent services virtual IP on the same network. 
 
1. For Kubernetes nodes, specify a contiguous range of six static IPs in the same subnet as the network for this port. 

   As part of the AKS deployment, two clusters are created, a management cluster and a target cluster. The IPs that you specified are used as follows:

   - The management cluster needs two IPs = 1 IP for management control plane network interface + 1 IP for API server (VIP).

   - The target cluster needs (2+n) IPs = 1 IP for target cluster control plane network interface + 1 IP for API server (VIP) + number of nodes, n.

   - An extra IP is used for rolling updates.

     For a single node device, the above results in six IPs to deploy a Kubernetes cluster. For a two node cluster, you need seven IPs.

1. For the Kubernetes external service IPs, supply static IPs for services that are exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. Each such service requires one IP. 

    [![Screenshot that shows the Compute virtual switch options on the Kubernetes page in the Azure portal.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-kubernetes-page-compute-virtual-switch.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-kubernetes-page-compute-virtual-switch.png#lightbox)

## Enable VM cloud management

This step is required to allow the Azure Stack Edge portal to deploy the infrastructure VMs on Azure Stack Edge device for AKS; for example, for the target cluster worker node.

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Stack Edge resource.

1. Go to **Overview** and select the **Virtual machines** tile.

   [![Screenshot that shows the Virtual machines tile on the Azure Stack Edge Overview page of the Azure portal.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-virtual-machines-tile.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-virtual-machines-tile.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Virtual machines** > **Overview** page, select **Enable** for **Virtual machines cloud management**.

   [![Screenshot that shows the Azure Stack Edge Overview page with the enable virtual machines cloud management option on the Azure portal.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-enable-virtual-machines-cloud-management.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-enable-virtual-machines-cloud-management.png#lightbox)

## Set up Kubernetes cluster and enable Arc

Use this step to set up and deploy the Kubernetes cluster, and enable it for management via Arc.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Before you create the Kubernetes cluster, keep in mind that:
   >- You can't modify the IP pool settings after the AKS cluster is deployed.
   >- As part of Arc-enabling the AKS target cluster, custom locations will be enabled if the object ID was passed using the optional command in the [Set custom locations (optional)](#set-custom-locations-optional) section in this article. If you didn’t enable custom locations, you can still choose to do so before the Kubernetes cluster is created. After the cluster deployment has started, you won’t be able to set custom locations.

Follow these steps to deploy the AKS cluster.

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Stack Edge resource.

1. Select the **Azure Kubernetes Service** tile.

1. Select **Add** to configure AKS.

1. On the **Create Kubernetes service** dialog, select the Kubernetes **Node size** for the infrastructure VM. Select a VM node size that's appropriate for the workload size you're deploying. In this example, we've selected VM size **Standard_F16s_HPN – 16 vCPUs, 32.77 GB memory**.

   For SAP deployments, select VM node size **Standard_DS5_v2**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the node size dropdown menu isn’t populated, wait a few minutes so that it's synchronized after VMs are enabled in the preceding step.

1. Check **Manage container from cloud via Arc enabled Kubernetes**. This option, when checked, enables Arc when the Kubernetes cluster is created.

1. If you select **Change**, then you need to provide a subscription name, resource group, cluster name, and region.

   [![Screenshot that shows the Configure Arc enabled Kubernetes options part of creating the Kubernetes service on the Azure portal.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-create-aks-configure-arc-enabled-kubernetes.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-create-aks-configure-arc-enabled-kubernetes.png#lightbox)

   1. The subscription name should be automatically populated.

   1. Specify a unique resource group name. You can also choose to use the same resource group in which you deployed your Azure Stack Edge resource. **You must have owner level access to this resource group.** To verify the access level for the resource group, go to **Resource group** > **Access control (IAM)** > **View my access**. Under **Role assignments**, you must be listed as an Owner.

      [![Screenshot that shows My assignments in the Access control page of the Azure Stack Edge UI.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-access-control-my-assignments.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-access-control-my-assignments.png#lightbox)

   1. Specify a name for your Arc enabled Kubernetes cluster or accept the default.

   1. Select a region where the resource for your Arc enabled Kubernetes cluster will be created. A filtered list of supported regions is displayed in the dropdown list.
   1. Select **Configure**. You can also reset the Arc settings by selecting the **Reset to default** option.

1. Select **Create** to create the Kubernetes service.

   [![Screenshot that shows the Create Kubernetes service page of the Azure Stack Edge UI.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-create-kubernetes-service.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-create-kubernetes-service.png#lightbox)

1. You're notified when the cluster creation starts.

   1. Once the Kubernetes cluster is created, you’ll see that the Azure Kubernetes Service is **Running**.

      [![Screenshot that shows the Azure Kubernetes Service running as expected.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-azure-arc-kubernetes-cluster-service-running.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-azure-arc-kubernetes-cluster-service-running.png#lightbox)

      The **Arc-enabled Kubernetes** will also show up as **Running**.

      [![Screenshot that shows the Azure Kubernetes Service Overview page with status of the Kubernetes service.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-azure-kubernetes-service-status.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-azure-kubernetes-service-status.png#lightbox)

      If you're planning to deploy Kubernetes workloads, you may next need to create Persistent Volumes to allocate storage.

## Add a persistent volume

**PersistentVolume (PV)** refers to a piece of storage in the Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes storage can be statically provisioned as `PersistentVolume`. It can also be dynamically provisioned as `StorageClass`. For more information, see [Storage requirements for Kubernetes pods](azure-stack-edge-gpu-kubernetes-storage.md#storage-requirements-for-kubernetes-pods). 

There are two different workflows for creating PVs depending on whether the compute is enabled inline when the share is created, or not. Each of these workflows is discussed in the following sections.

### Create a persistent volume with compute enabled inline during share creation

On your Azure Stack Edge Pro device, statically provisioned `PersistentVolumes` are created using the device's storage capabilities. When you provision a share and the **Use the share with Edge compute** option is enabled, this action automatically creates a PV resource in the Kubernetes cluster.

[![Screenshot that shows Cloud storage gateway to add a share with the Use the share with Edge compute option.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-add-share-using-edge-compute-option-1.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-add-share-using-edge-compute-option-1.png#lightbox)

To use cloud tiering, you can create an Edge cloud share with the **Use the share with Edge compute** option enabled. A PV is again created automatically for this share. If you enable this option, any application data that you write to the Edge share is tiered to the cloud.

[![Screenshot that shows Cloud storage gateway to add a share with the Use the share with Edge local share option enabled.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-add-share-using-edge-compute-option-2.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-add-share-using-edge-compute-option-2.png#lightbox)


### Create a persistent volume with compute not enabled inline during share creation

For the shares that were created with the **Use the share with Edge compute** option unchecked, you can add a persistent volume using the following steps.

1. In the Azure portal, go to the Azure Stack Edge resource for your device. Go to **Cloud storage gateway** > **Shares**. You can see that the device currently has shares with the **Used for compute** status enabled.

   [![Screenshot that shows the Cloud storage gateway shares with Edge compute enabled.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-cloud-storage-gateway-shares-with-edge-compute-enabled.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-cloud-storage-gateway-shares-with-edge-compute-enabled.png#lightbox)

1. Select **+ Add share**. For this share, make sure that the **Use the share with Edge compute** option is unchecked.

   [![Screenshot that shows the Add share dialog for Persistent volume with compute not enabled inline during share creation.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-add-share-with-compute-not-enabled.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-add-share-with-compute-not-enabled.png#lightbox)

1. You can see the newly created share in the list of shares and the **Used for compute** status is **Disabled**.

   [![Screenshot that shows the newly created share in the list of shares and the Used for compute status is Disabled.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-new-share-with-edge-compute-option-disabled.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-new-share-with-edge-compute-option-disabled.png#lightbox)

1. Go back to the **Azure Stack Edge resource** > **Overview**. In the right-pane, select the **Azure Kubernetes Service** tile. 

   [![Screenshot that shows the Azure Stack Edge resource Overview page with the Azure Kubernetes Service tile selected.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-overview-page-showing-azure-kubernetes-service-tile-selected.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-overview-page-showing-azure-kubernetes-service-tile-selected.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Azure Kubernetes Service** > **Overview** page, the **Persistent volumes** tile shows the persistent volumes that exist. These volumes were created automatically when the shares were created with the **Use the share with Edge compute** option enabled. To create a new persistent volume, select **+ Add persistent volume**.

1. In the **Add Persistent volumes** dialog, select the share for which you want to create the persistent volume.

   [![Screenshot that shows the Azure Stack Edge dialog for Add Persistent volumes.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-add-persistent-volumes.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-add-persistent-volumes.png#lightbox)

1. You see a notification that the persistent volume is being created. This operation takes a few minutes to complete.

   [![Screenshot that shows a Notifications dialog that the Adding Persistent Volumes operation has successfully completed.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-adding-persistent-volumes-success-notification.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-adding-persistent-volumes-success-notification.png#lightbox)

1. After the persistent volume is created, the **Overview** page updates to include the newly added persistent volume. 

   [![Screenshot that shows the Azure Kubernetes Service Overview page with Persistent Volumes.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-azure-kubernetes-service-overview-page-with-persistent-volumes.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-azure-kubernetes-service-overview-page-with-persistent-volumes.png#lightbox)

1. Select **View all persistent volumes** to see the newly created persistent volume.

## Remove the Azure Kubernetes service

Use the following steps in the Azure portal to remove AKS.

1. In your Azure Stack Edge resource, go to **Azure Kubernetes Service** > **Overview**.

1. From the top command bar, select **Remove**.

   [![Screenshot that shows the Azure Kubernetes Service Overview page with the Remove option.](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-azure-kubernetes-service-overview-page-with-remove-option.png)](./media/azure-stack-edge-deploy-aks-on-azure-stack-edge/azure-stack-edge-azure-kubernetes-service-overview-page-with-remove-option.png#lightbox)

1. Select the configured addon that you want to remove along with AKS. Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes is an addon. Once you select **Remove**, all Kubernetes configurations and the selected addon will be removed. The operation is irreversible and can’t be undone.

1.  Select **OK** to confirm the operation.
