## Power supply unit specifications

The Azure Stack Edge Pro device has two 100-240 V power supply units (PSUs) with high-performance fans. The two PSUs provide a redundant power configuration. If a PSU fails, the device continues to operate normally on the other PSU until the failed module is replaced. The following table lists the technical specifications of the PSUs.

| Specification           | 750 W PSU                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Maximum output power    | 750 W                      |
| Frequency               | 50/60 Hz                   |
| Voltage range selection | Auto ranging: 100-240 V AC |
| Hot pluggable           | Yes                        |


## Network interface specifications

Your Azure Stack Edge Pro device has six network interfaces, PORT1- PORT6.

| Specification           | Description                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
|  Network interfaces    | **2 X 1 GbE interfaces** – 1 management interface Port 1 is used for initial setup and is static by default. After the initial setup is complete, you can use the interface for data with any IP address. However, on reset, the interface reverts back to static IP. <br>The other interface Port 2 is user configurable, can be used for data transfer, and is DHCP by default. <br>**4 X 25-GbE interfaces** – These data interfaces, Port 3 through Port 6, can be configured by user as DHCP (default) or static. They can also operate as 10-GbE interfaces.  | 

Your Azure Stack Edge Pro device has the following network hardware:

* **Custom Microsoft `Qlogic` Cavium 25G NDC adapter** - Port 1 through port 4.
* **Mellanox dual port 25G ConnectX-4 channel network adapter** - Port 5 and port 6.

Here are the details for the Mellanox card:

| Parameter           | Description                 |
