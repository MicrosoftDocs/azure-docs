## Prerequisites

Before you configure and set up your device, make sure that:

* You've installed the physical device as detailed in [Install Azure Stack Edge Pro 2](azure-stack-edge-pro-2-deploy-install.md).


## Connect to the local web UI setup

::: zone pivot="single-node"

1. Configure the Ethernet adapter on your computer to connect to your device with a static IP address of 192.168.100.5 and subnet 255.255.255.0.

2. Connect the computer to PORT 1 on your device. If connecting the computer to the device directly (without a switch), use an Ethernet crossover cable or a USB Ethernet adapter. Use the following illustration to identify PORT 1 on your device.

    The back plane of the device may look slightly different depending on the exact model you’ve received. For more information, see [Cable your device](azure-stack-edge-pro-2-deploy-install.md#cable-the-device).


3. Open a browser window and access the local web UI of the device at `https://192.168.100.10`.  
    This action may take a few minutes after you've turned on the device.

    You see an error or a warning indicating that there’s a problem with the website's security certificate.

4. Select **Continue to this webpage**.  
    These steps might vary depending on the browser you're using.

5. Sign in to the web UI of your device. The default password is *Password1*.

6. At the prompt, change the device administrator password.  
    The new password must contain between 8 and 16 characters. It must contain three of the following characters: uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.

You're now at the **Overview** page of your device. The next step is to configure the network settings for your device.
