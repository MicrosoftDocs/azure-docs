# Cluster failover scenarios on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device

This article identifies the common failover scenarios, how the Azure Stack Edge device responds, and the overall impact on the workloads deployed on the cluster should a failover occur.

## About failover 

Azure Stack Edge can be set up as a single standalone device or a two-node cluster. In a two-node cluster, the clustered nodes provide high availability for applications and services that are running on the cluster. 

If one of the clustered node fails, the other node begins to provide service - this process is known as failover. Failover may also occur if hardware components associated with one or both nodes of your device such as disk drives, power supply units (PSUs), or network fail or when you update your device nodes.

## Failover scenarios 

Failover may occur as a result of hardware component failure, node failure or when updating the Azure Stack Edge cluster.


## Hardware failures

These tables summarize the failure scenarios for a physical hardware component associated with your device cluster such as one or more of disk drives, power supply, or network.

### Disk drive failures

<!--## High availability requirements and procedures 

Review the following information carefully to ensure the high availability of your Azure Stack Edge two-node devices.

### PSUs

Azure Stack Edge devices include redundant, hot-swappable power supply units (PSUs). Each PSU has enough capacity to provide service for the entire chassis. To ensure high availability, both PSUs must be installed. Are these hot swappable?

- Connect your PSUs to different power sources to provide availability if a power source fails.
- If a PSU fails, request a replacement immediately.
- Remove a failed PSU only when you have the replacement and are ready to install it.
- Do not remove both PSUs concurrently. Removing both of the PSUs of one of the nodes will result in failover. 

### Nodes

Azure Stack Edge devices include two nodes working together as a two-node cluster. 

- For a two-node cluster to work properly, make sure that both nodes are installed at all times.
- If a node fails, request a replacement immediately.
- Remove a failed node only when you have the replacement and are ready to install it. 

### Network interfaces

Azure Stack Edge devices each have two 1 Gigabit and four 10 Gigabit Ethernet network interfaces.

- When possible, deploy network connections across different switches to ensure service availability in the event of a network device failure.
- Connect at least two data interfaces to the network from each node.
- If you have enabled the two 10 GbE interfaces, deploy those across different switches.


### SSDs 

Azure Stack Edge devices include NVMe solid state disks (SSDs) that are protected using mirrored spaces. Use of mirrored spaces ensures that the device is able to tolerate the failure of one or more SSDs.

- Make sure that all SSDs modules are installed.
- If an SSD fails, request a replacement immediately.
- If an SSD fails or requires replacement, make sure that you remove only the SSD that requires replacement.
- Do not remove more than one SSD from the system at any point in time. A failure of 2 or more disks on a node would result in failover to another node. -->
