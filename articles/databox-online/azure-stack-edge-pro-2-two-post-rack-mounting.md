# Tutorial: Rack the Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 using a two-post mount

Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 is the next generation of an AI-enabled edge computing device that can transfer data over the network. This device is a part of the Hardware-as-a-service solution  offered by Microsoft. 

The device must be installed on a standard 19-inch rack. Use the following procedure to rack mount your device on a standard 19-inch rack using a two-post mount.

## Prerequisites

* Before you begin, read the safety instructions in your Safety, Environmental, and Regulatory Information booklet. This booklet was shipped with the device.
* Begin installing the rails in the allotted space that is closest to the bottom of the rack enclosure.
* For the rack mounting configuration, you need to supply:
    * A Phillips-head screwdriver 

    

## Identify the rail kit contents

* Inner rail
* Chassis
* The following screws and nuts:
