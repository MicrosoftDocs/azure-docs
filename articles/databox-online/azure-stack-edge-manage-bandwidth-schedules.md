# Use the Azure portal to manage bandwidth schedules on your Azure Stack Edge Pro FPGA  

[!INCLUDE [Azure Stack Edge Pro FPGA end-of-life](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-fpga-eol.md)]

This article describes how to manage users on your Azure Stack Edge Pro FPGA. Bandwidth schedules allow you to configure network bandwidth usage across multiple time-of-day schedules. These schedules can be applied to the upload and download operations from your device to the cloud.

You can add, modify, or delete the bandwidth schedules for your Azure Stack Edge Pro FPGA via the Azure portal.

3. In the **Add schedule**: 

   1. Provide the **Start day**, **End day**, **Start time**, and **End time** of the schedule.
   2. Check the **All day** option if this schedule should run all day.
   3. **Bandwidth rate** is the bandwidth in Megabits per second (Mbps) used by your device in operations involving the cloud (both uploads and downloads). Supply a number between 20 and 1,000,000,007 for this field.
   4. Check **Unlimited** bandwidth if you do not want to throttle the date upload and download.
   5. Select **Add**.
