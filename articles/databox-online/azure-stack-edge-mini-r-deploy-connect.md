## Prerequisites

Before you configure and set up your Azure Stack Edge device, make sure that:

* You've installed the physical device as detailed in [Install Azure Stack Edge](azure-stack-edge-mini-r-deploy-install.md).
* You've run the Azure Stack Network Readiness Checker tool to verify that your network meets Azure Stack Edge requirements. For instructions, see [Check network readiness for Azure Stack Edge devices](azure-stack-edge-deploy-check-network-readiness.md).


## Connect to the local web UI setup

1. Configure the Ethernet adapter on your computer to connect to the Azure Stack Edge Pro device with a static IP address of 192.168.100.5 and subnet 255.255.255.0.

2. Connect the computer to PORT 1 on your device. If connecting the computer to the device directly (without a switch), use an Ethernet crossover cable or a USB Ethernet adapter. Use the following illustration to identify PORT 1 on your device.
