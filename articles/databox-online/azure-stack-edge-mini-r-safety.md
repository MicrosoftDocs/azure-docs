These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference when the equipment is operated in a commercial environment. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. Operation of this equipment in a residential area is likely to cause harmful interference in which case the user will be required to correct the interference at their own expense.

The  Netgear A6150 WiFi USB Adapter provided with this equipment is intended to be operated close to the human body are tested for body-worn Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) compliance. The SAR limit set by the FCC is 1.6 W/kg when averaged over 1 g of tissue. When carrying the product or using it while worn on your body, maintain a distance of 10 mm from the body to ensure compliance with RF exposure requirements.

The Netgear A6150 WiFi USB Adapter complies with ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1999 and was tested in accordance with the measurement methods and procedures specified in OET Bulletin 65 Supplement C.

Netgear A6150 Specific Absorption Rate (SAR): 1.18 W/kg averaged over 1 g of tissue

The Netgear A6150 WiFi USB Adapter is to be used with approved antennas only. This device and its antenna(s) must not be co-located or operating with any other antenna or transmitter except in accordance with FCC multitransmitter product procedures. For products available in the USA market, only channel 1~11 can be operated. Selection of other channels is not possible.

Operation in the band 5150–5250 MHz is only for indoor use to reduce the potential for harmful interference to co-channel mobile satellite systems.

![Regulatory information warning - indoor use](./media/azure-stack-edge-mini-r-safety/regulatory-information-indoor-use-only.png)

Users are advised that high-power radars are allocated as primary users (priority users) of the bands 5250–5350 MHz and 5650–5850 MHz, and these radars could cause interference and/or damage to LE-LAN devices.

This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there's no guarantee that interference won't occur in a particular installation.

If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:

- Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.
- Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.
- Connect the equipment to an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is connected.
- Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help.

For more information about interference issues, go to the FCC website at [fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/interference.html](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/interference-radio-tv-and-telephone-signals). You can also call the FCC at 1-888-CALL FCC to request Interference and Telephone Interference fact sheets.

Additional information about radiofrequency safety can be found on the FCC website at [https://www.fcc.gov/general/radio-frequency-safety-0](https://www.fcc.gov/general/radio-frequency-safety-0) and the Industry Canada website at [http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01904.html](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01904.html).

This product demonstrates EMC compliance under conditions that included the use of compliant peripheral devices and shielded cables between system components. It's important that you use compliant peripheral devices and shielded cables between system components to reduce the possibility of causing interference to radios, television sets, and other electronic devices.
