# Apply billing tags

Billing tags are metadata elements that you can apply to Microsoft Customer Agreement MCA billing entities including billing profiles and invoice sections. Just like Azure tags, billing tags are key-value pairs that are used to identify the entities.

For example, to identify an invoice section with subscriptions belonging to the marketing department, you could use the tag with `key` : *Department* and `value` : *Marketing*.  The fully formed `key` : *value* pair would be `Department` : *Marketing*.

> [!NOTE]
> The limitations and recommendations that apply to Azure tags also apply to billing tags.

> [!WARNING]
> Tags are stored as plain text. Never add sensitive values to tags. Sensitive values could be exposed through many methods, including cost reports, commands that return existing tag definitions, deployment histories, exported templates, and monitoring logs.

## Tag inheritance and billing tags

When you enable the **Tag inheritance** setting at the billing profile level, tags from billing profile and invoices sections are applied to usage records for all child resources.
