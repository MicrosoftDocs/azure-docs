# Quickstart: Create a budget with an ARM template

Budgets in Cost Management help you plan for and drive organizational accountability. With budgets, you can account for the Azure services you consume or subscribe to during a specific period. They help you inform others about their spending to proactively manage costs, and to monitor how spending progresses over time. When the budget thresholds you've created are exceeded, notifications are triggered. None of your resources are affected and your consumption isn't stopped. You can use budgets to compare and track spending as you analyze costs. This quickstart shows you how to create a budget using three different Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM template).

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the **Deploy to Azure** button for one of the following templates. The template will open in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

If you have a new subscription, you can't immediately create a budget or use other Cost Management features. It might take up to 48 hours before you can use all Cost Management features.

Budgets are supported for the following types of Azure account types and scopes:

- Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) scopes
    - Management groups
    - Subscription
- Enterprise Agreement scopes
    - Billing account
    - Department
    - Enrollment account
- Individual agreements
    - Billing account
- Microsoft Customer Agreement scopes
    - Billing account
    - Billing profile
    - Invoice section
    - Customer
- AWS scopes
    - External account
    - External subscription
        > [!NOTE]
        > The Connector for AWS in the Cost Management service retires on March 31, 2025. Users should consider alternative solutions for AWS cost management reporting. On March 31, 2024, Azure will disable the ability to add new Connectors for AWS for all customers. For more information, see [Retire your Amazon Web Services (AWS) connector](retire-aws-connector.md).
To view budgets, you need at least read access for your Azure account.

For Azure EA subscriptions, you must have read access to view budgets. To create and manage budgets, you must have contributor permission.

The following Azure permissions, or scopes, are supported per subscription for budgets by user and group. For more information about scopes, see [Understand and work with scopes](understand-work-scopes.md).

- Owner – Can create, modify, or delete budgets for a subscription.
- Contributor and Cost Management contributor – Can create, modify, or delete their own budgets. Can modify the budget amount for budgets created by others.
- Reader and Cost Management reader – Can view budgets that they have permission to.

For more information about assigning permission to Cost Management data, see [Assign access to Cost Management data](assign-access-acm-data.md).

Use one of the following templates, based on your needs.

| Template | Description |
| --- | --- |
| No filter | The ARM template doesn't have any filters. |
| One filter | The ARM template has a filter for resource groups. |
| Two or more filters | The ARM template has a filter for resource groups and a filter for meter categories. |

## Review and deploy the template

## [No filter](#tab/no-filter)

### Review the template

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/create-budget-simple).

    * **Amount**: enter the total amount of cost to track with the budget.
    * **Time Grain**: enter the time covered by a budget. Allowed values are Monthly, Quarterly, or Annually. The budget resets at the end of the time grain.
    * **Start Date**: enter the start date with the first day of the month in YYYY-MM-DD format. A future start date shouldn't be more than three months from today. You can specify a past start date with the Time Grain period.
    * **End Date**: enter the end date for the budget in YYYY-MM-DD format. 
    * **First Threshold**: enter a threshold value for the first notification. A notification is sent when the cost exceeds the threshold. It's always percent and has to be between 0.01 and 1000.
    * **Second Threshold**: enter a threshold value for the second notification. A notification is sent when the cost exceeds the threshold. It's always percent and has to be between 0.01 and 1000.

Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing** > select a scope > **Budgets**.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

```azurecli-interactive
az consumption budget list
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzConsumptionBudget
```

---

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need a budget, delete it by using one the following methods:

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing** > select a billing scope > **Budgets** > select a budget > then select **Delete budget**.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Enter the budget name:" &&
read budgetName &&
az consumption budget delete --budget-name $budgetName &&

```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
$budgetName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the budget name"
Remove-AzConsumptionBudget -Name $budgetName
Write-Host "Press [ENTER] to continue..."
```
