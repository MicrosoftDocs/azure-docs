    questions:
      - question: How do I view reservation charges?
        answer: |
          In the Azure portal, navigate to **Cost Management + Billing** > **Cost Management** > **Cost analysis**. Add a filter for **Pricing Model: Reservation**.
          
          You can choose to view either the actual cost (reflecting when the purchase was charged) or the amortized cost (which spreads the cost of the Reservation across the resources that used it).
          
          To switch between these views, select the down arrow next to the Actual Cost KPI and select your desired metric from the drop-down.
      - question: How do I see reservation savings?
        answer: |
          There are a couple of ways to view your savings.
