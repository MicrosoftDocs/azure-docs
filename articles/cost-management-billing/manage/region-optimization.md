# Region optimization for Microsoft Azure customers

This article helps you understand the region optimization policy and how it might affect you. The purpose of the region optimization policy is to help you get the best possible performance. The policy relies on finding the list of the best available healthy regions based on your geography.

The policy might affect you when you try to create a resource in a region that can’t support your request. In this situation, you might see a message like the following notification:

`You can create resources in the following regions <ListofRegions> only. For business reasons, if you need access to any other regions, please see the Region optimization article for help.`

The region optimization policy is designed to be flexible, scalable, and secure while balancing our customer needs, capacity optimization, and security.

If you have a suitable business reason and the region where you want to deploy resources isn’t available to you, you can submit a [support request in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).
