# Troubleshoot a declined card at Azure sign-up

You may experience an issue or error in which a credit card is declined at Azure sign-up in either the Microsoft Azure portal, or the Azure account center.

To resolve your issue, select the topic below which most closely resembles your error.

## The credit card provider is not accepted for your country/region

When you choose a card, Azure displays the card options that are valid in the country/region that you select. Contact your bank or card issuer to verify that your credit card is enabled for international transactions. For more information about supported countries/regions and currencies, see the [Azure Purchase FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/faq/).

>[!Note]
>American Express credit cards are not currently supported as a payment instrument in India. We have no time frame as to when it may be an accepted form of payment.

## You're using a virtual or prepaid card

Virtual or prepaid credit or debit cards aren't accepted as payment for Azure subscriptions.

## Your credit information is inaccurate or incomplete

The name, address, and CVV code that you enter must match exactly what's printed on the card.

## The card is inactive or blocked

Contact your bank to make sure that your card is active.

You may be experiencing other sign-up issues

## You represent a business that doesn't want to pay by card

If you represent a business, you can use invoice payment methods such as checks, overnight checks, or wire transfers to pay for your Azure subscription. After you set up the account to pay by invoice, you can't change to another payment option, unless you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement and signed up for Azure through the Azure website.

For more information about how to pay by invoice, see [Submit a request to pay Azure subscription by invoice](pay-by-invoice.md).

## Your credit card information is outdated

For information about how to manage your card information, including changing or removing a card, see [Add, update, or remove a credit for Azure](change-credit-card.md).
