# Transfer Azure product billing ownership to a Microsoft Customer Agreement

This article helps you transfer billing ownership for your Azure products (subscriptions, reservations, and savings plans) to a Microsoft Customer Agreement when:

- You want to move billing responsibilities for a product to a different billing owner.
- You want to transfer your Azure products from one licensing agreement to another. For example, from an Enterprise Agreement or a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA) to a Microsoft Customer Agreement.
- You want to transfer reservation or savings plan ownership.

[Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-for-access).

The transition moves only the billing responsibility for your Azure products â€“ the Azure resources tied to your products don't move, so the transition doesn't interrupt your Azure services.

This process contains the following primary tasks:

1. Request billing ownership
2. Review and approve the transfer request
3. Check transfer request status

There are four options to transfer products:

- Transfer only subscriptions
- Transfer only reservations
- Transfer only savings plans
- Transfer a combination of products

When you send or accept a transfer request, you agree to terms and conditions. For more information, see [Transfer terms and conditions](subscription-transfer.md#transfer-terms-and-conditions).

Before you transfer billing products, read [Supplemental information about transfers](subscription-transfer.md#supplemental-information-about-transfers).

[!INCLUDE [cost-management-billing-subscription-b2b-b2c-transfer-note](../../../includes/cost-management-billing-subscription-b2b-b2c-transfer-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

>[!IMPORTANT]
> - When you have a savings plan purchased under an Enterprise Agreement enrollment that was bought in a non-USD currency, you can't transfer it. Instead you must use it in the original enrollment. However, you change the scope of the savings plan so that is used by other subscriptions. For more information, see [Change the savings plan scope](../savings-plan/manage-savings-plan.md#change-the-savings-plan-scope). You can view your billing currency in the Azure portal on the enrollment properties page. For more information, see [To view enrollment properties](direct-ea-administration.md#to-view-enrollment-properties).
> - When you transfer subscriptions, cost and usage data for your Azure products aren't accessible after the transfer. We recommend that you [download your cost and usage data](../understand/download-azure-daily-usage.md) and invoices before you transfer subscriptions.
> - When there's a currency change during or after transfer, reservations paid for monthly are canceled. Cancellation happens at the time of the next monthly payment for an individual reservation. The cancellation is intentional and only affects monthly, not up front, reservation purchases. For more information, see [Transfer Azure Enterprise enrollment accounts and subscriptions](ea-transfers.md#prerequisites-1).

Before you begin, make sure that the people involved in the product transfer have the required permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> To perform a transfer, the destination account must be a paid account with a valid form of payment. For example, if the destination is an Azure free account, you can upgrade it to a pay-as-you-go Azure plan under a Microsoft Customer Agreement. Then you can make the transfer.

You can also go along with the following video that outlines each step of the process for subscription transfer. However, it doesn't cover reservation or savings plan transfers.

### Required permission for the transfer requestor

The product transfer requestor must have one of the following permissions:

For a Microsoft Customer Agreement, the person must have an owner or contributor role for the billing account or for the relevant billing profile or invoice section. For more information, see [Billing roles and tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#invoice-section-roles-and-tasks).

### Required permission for the transfer recipient 

The subscription, reservation, or savings plan product owner (transfer request recipient) must have one of the following permissions:

- For a Microsoft Customer Agreement, the person must have an owner or contributor role for the billing account or for the relevant billing profile or invoice section. For more information, see [Billing roles and tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#invoice-section-roles-and-tasks).
- For an Enterprise Agreement subscription, the person must be an account owner or EA administrator.
- For an Enterprise Agreement savings plan or reservation, the person must be an EA administrator
- For a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement, the person must be an Account Administrator.

## Create the product transfer request

The person creating the transfer request uses the following procedure to create the transfer request. The transfer request essentially asks the owner of the product to allow subscriptions and or reservations associated with a subscription to be transferred.

When the request is created, an email is sent to the target recipient.

The following procedure has you navigate to **Transfer requests** by selecting a **Billing scope** > **Billing account** > **Billing profile** > **Invoice sections** to **Add a new request**. If you navigate to **Add a new request** from selecting a billing profile, select a billing profile, and then select an invoice section.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as an invoice section owner or contributor for a billing account for Microsoft Customer Agreement. Use the same credentials that you used to accept your Microsoft Customer Agreement.
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-search-cost-management-billing.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Azure portal search for Cost Management + Billing." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-search-cost-management-billing.png" :::
1. On the billing scopes page, select **Billing scopes** and then select the billing account, which would be used to pay for Azure usage in your products. Select the billing account labeled **Microsoft Customer Agreement**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-scopes.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows search in portal for Cost Management + Billing." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-scopes.png" :::  
        The Azure portal remembers the last billing scope that you access and displays the scope the next time you come to Cost Management + Billing page. You don't see the billing scopes page if you visited Cost Management + Billing earlier. If so, check that you are in the [right scope](#check-for-access). If not, [switch the scope](view-all-accounts.md#switch-billing-scope-in-the-azure-portal) to select the billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement.
1. Select **Billing profiles** from the left-hand side and then select a **Billing profile** from the list. Once you take over the ownership of the products, their usage is billed to this billing profile.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-profile.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting billing profiles." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-profile.png" :::  
    *If you don't see Billing profiles, you aren't in the right billing scope.* You need to select a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement and then select Billing profiles. To learn how to change scopes, see [Switch billing scopes in the Azure portal](view-all-accounts.md#switch-billing-scope-in-the-azure-portal).
1. Select **Invoice sections** from the left-hand side and then select an invoice section from the list. Each billing profile contains on invoice section by default. Select the invoice where you want to move your Azure product billing - that's where the Azure product consumption is transferred to.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/invoice-section.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting invoice sections." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/invoice-section.png" :::  
1. Select **Transfer requests** from the lower-left side and then select **Add a new request**. Enter the email address of the user you're requesting billing ownership from. The user must have an account administrator role for the old products.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-request-add-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting transfer requests." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-request-add-email.png" :::
1. Select **Send transfer request**.

## Review and approve transfer request

The recipient of the transfer request uses the following procedure to review and approve the transfer request. They can choose to:

- Transfer one or more subscriptions only
- Transfer one or more reservations only
- Transfer one or more savings plans only
- Transfer a combination of products

1. The user gets an email with instructions to review your transfer request. Select **Review the request** to open it in the Azure portal.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-review-transfer-request-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows review transfer request email." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-review-transfer-request-email.png" :::  
    If the transfer recipientâ€™s user account doesnâ€™t have email enabled, the person that created the request can manually give the target recipient a link to accept the transfer request after the request is created. The person that created the request can navigate to Transfer status page, copy it, and then manually give it to the recipient.  
        :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-status-pending-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Transfer status where you can copy the transfer link sent to the recipient." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-status-pending-link.png" :::
1. In the Azure portal, the user selects the billing account that they want to transfer Azure products from. Then they select eligible subscriptions on the **Subscriptions** tab. If the owner doesnâ€™t want to transfer subscriptions and instead wants to transfer reservations only, make sure that no subscriptions are selected.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-subscriptions-select.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Subscriptions tab." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-subscriptions-select.png" :::  
    *Disabled subscriptions can't be transferred.*
1. If there are reservations available to transfer, select the **Reservations** tab, and then select them. If you don't want to transfer reservations, make sure that no reservations are selected.  
If reservations are transferred, they're applied to the scope thatâ€™s set in the request. If you want to change the scope of the reservation after itâ€™s transferred, see [Change the reservation scope](../reservations/manage-reserved-vm-instance.md#change-the-reservation-scope).
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-reservations-select.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Reservations tab." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-reservations-select.png" :::
1. If there are savings plans available to transfer, select the **Saving plan** tab, and then select them. If you don't want to transfer savings plans, make sure that no savings plans are selected.  
If savings plans are transferred, they're applied to the scope thatâ€™s set in the request. If you want to change the scope of the savings plan after itâ€™s transferred, see [Change the savings plan scope](../savings-plan/manage-savings-plan.md#change-the-savings-plan-scope).
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-savings-plan-select.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Savings plan tab." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-savings-plan-select.png" :::

1. Select the **Review request** tab and verify the information about the products to transfer. If there are Warnings or Failed status messages, see the following information. When you're ready to continue, select **Transfer**.   
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Review request tab where you review your transfer selections." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-complete.png" :::
1. The `Transfer is in progress` message is briefly shown. When the transfer is completed successfully, you see the Transfer details page with the `Transfer completed successfully` message.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-completed-successfully.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Transfer completed successfully page." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-completed-successfully.png" :::

On the Review request tab, the following status messages might be displayed.

* **Ready to transfer** - Validation for this Azure product has passed and can be transferred.
* **Warnings** - There's a warning for the selected Azure product. While the product can still be transferred, doing so has some consequence that the user should be aware of in case they want to take mitigating actions. For example, the Azure subscription being transferred is benefitting from a reservation. After transfer, the subscription will no longer receive that benefit. To maximize savings, ensure that the reservation is associated to another subscription that can use its benefits. Instead, the user can also choose to go back to the selection page and unselect this Azure subscription. Select **Check details** for more information.
* **Failed** - The selected Azure product can't be transferred because of an error. The user needs to go back to the selection page and unselect this product to transfer the other selected Azure products.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Troubleshooting

Use the following troubleshooting information if you're having trouble transferring subscriptions.

### Original Azure subscription billing owner leaves your organization

It's possible that the original billing account owner who created an Azure account and an Azure subscription leaves your organization. If that situation happens, then their user identity is no longer in the organization's Microsoft Entra ID. Then the Azure subscription doesn't have a billing owner. This situation prevents anyone from performing billing operations to the account, including viewing and paying bills. The subscription could go into a past-due state. Eventually, the subscription could get disabled because of nonpayment. Ultimately, the subscription could get deleted, affecting every service that runs on the subscription.

When a subscription no longer has a valid billing account owner, Azure sends an email to other Billing account owner and Subscription Owners informing them of the situation and provides them with a link to accept billing ownership of the subscription. Any one of the users can select the link to accept billing ownership. For more information about billing roles, see [Billing Roles](understand-mca-roles.md) and [Azure roles, Microsoft Entra roles, and classic subscription administrator roles](../../role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles.md).

Here's an example of what the email looks like.

:::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/orphaned-subscription-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an example email to accept billing ownership." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/orphaned-subscription-email.png" :::

Additionally, Azure shows a banner in the subscription's details window in the Azure portal to Billing owners and Subscription Owners. Select the link in the banner to accept billing ownership.

:::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/orphaned-subscription-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an example of a subscription without a valid billing owner." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/orphaned-subscription-example.png" :::
