# Get started with the Azure Enterprise portal

This article helps direct and indirect Azure Enterprise Agreement (Azure EA) customers start to use the [Azure Enterprise portal](https://ea.azure.com). Get basic information about:

- The structure of the Azure Enterprise portal.
- Roles used in the Azure Enterprise portal.
- Subscription creation.
- Cost analysis in the Azure Enterprise portal and the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that both direct and indirect EA Azure customers use Cost Management + Billing in the Azure portal to manage their enrollment and billing instead of using the EA portal. For more information about enrollment management in the Azure portal, see [Get started with EA billing in the Azure portal](ea-direct-portal-get-started.md).
>
> As of February 20, 2023 indirect EA customers won’t be able to manage their billing account in the EA portal. Instead, they must use the Azure portal. 
> 
> This change doesn’t affect Azure Government EA enrollments. They continue using the EA portal to manage their enrollment.

## Understanding EA user roles and introduction to user hierarchy

To help manage your organization's usage and spend, Azure customers with an Enterprise Agreement (EA) can assign five distinct administrative roles:

- Enterprise Administrator
- Enterprise Administrator (read only)
- Department Administrator
- Department Administrator (read only)
- Account Owner

Each role has a varying degree of user limits and permissions. For more information, see [Organization structure and permissions by role](./understand-ea-roles.md#organization-structure-and-permissions-by-role).

## Activate your enrollment, create a subscription, and other administrative tasks

For more information regarding activating your enrollment, creating a department or subscription, adding administrators and account owners, and other administrative tasks, see [Azure EA portal administration](./ea-portal-administration.md).

If you’d like to know more about transferring an Enterprise subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, see [Azure Enterprise transfers](./ea-transfers.md).

## View usage summary and download reports

You can manage and act on your Azure EA invoice. Your invoice is a representation of your bill and should be reviewed for accuracy.

To view usage summary, download reports, and manage enrollment invoices, see [Azure Enterprise enrollment invoices](./ea-portal-enrollment-invoices.md).
