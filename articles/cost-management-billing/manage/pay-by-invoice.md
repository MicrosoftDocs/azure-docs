# Pay for your Azure subscription by invoice

This article applies to customers with a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) and who signed up for Azure through the Azure website. [Check your access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement). If you signed up for Azure through a Microsoft representative, then your default payment method will already be set to *check or wire transfer*.

If you switch to pay by invoice, that means you pay your bill within 30 days of the invoice date by check/wire transfer. To become eligible to pay for your Azure subscription by invoice, submit a request to Azure support. Once your request is approved, you can switch to invoice pay (check/wire transfer) in the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Invoice pay (check/wire transfer) is only available for customers using Azure on behalf of a company.
> * Pay all outstanding charges before switching to invoice pay.
> * Currently, invoice payment isn't supported for Global Azure in China.
