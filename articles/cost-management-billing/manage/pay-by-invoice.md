# Pay for your Azure subscription by wire transfer

This article helps you set up your Azure subscription to pay by wire transfer.

This article applies to you if you meet one of these conditions:

- You have a Microsoft Customer Agreement.
- You signed up for Azure through the Azure website to create a Microsoft Online Subscription Program account. This type of account is also called a *pay-as-you-go* account.

If you signed up for Azure through a Microsoft representative, your default payment method is already set to wire transfer. You don't need to follow the steps in this article.

When you switch to payment by wire transfer:

- Specify the invoice ID that you want to pay on your wire transfer.
- Send the wire payment to the designated bank, as stated on your monthly invoice.
- Send the exact amount on the invoice.
- Pay the bill by the due date.

## Prerequisites

Users who have a Microsoft Customer Agreement must [submit an Azure support request](#submit-a-request-to-set-up-payment-by-wire-transfer) to set up payment by wire transfer. Any user who has access to the Microsoft Online Subscription Program (pay-as-you-go) billing profile can submit the request to pay by wire transfer.

Currently, customers who have a Microsoft Online Subscription Program (pay-as-you-go) account must [submit an Azure support request](#submit-a-request-to-set-up-payment-by-wire-transfer) to set up payment by wire transfer.

## Submit a request to set up payment by wire transfer

Users in all regions can manually submit an Azure support request to pay by wire transfer. If your request is approved, you can switch to payment by wire transfer in the Azure portal by using the following steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, and then search for and select **Help + support**.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/pay-by-invoice/search-for-help-and-support.png" alt-text="Screenshot of searching for Help and support in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/pay-by-invoice/search-for-help-and-support.png" :::
1. Select **New support request**.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/pay-by-invoice/help-and-support.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the link for starting a new support request." lightbox="./media/pay-by-invoice/help-and-support.png" :::
1. For **Issue type**, select **Billing**. The *issue type* is the support request category. Select the subscription for which you want to pay by wire transfer, select a support plan, and then select **Next**.
1. For **Problem type**, select **Manage Payment Methods**. The *problem type* is the support request subcategory.
1. For **Problem subtype**, select **Switch to pay by invoice as my default payment method**.
1. In the **Details** box, enter the following information, and then select **Next**.

    - Whether you're a new or existing customer.
    - Current payment method, if you're an existing customer.
    - Order ID (requesting for invoice option).
    - Microsoft account ID for account admins. This ID should be a company domain.
    - Commerce account ID. To find this ID in the Azure portal:
      1. Search for **Cost Management** and select it (not **Cost Management + Billing**). It's a green hexagon-shaped symbol.
      1. On the left menu, select **Properties**. If **Properties** doesn't appear on the left menu, go to the top of the pane under **Scope**, and then select **Go to billing account**.

         On the **Properties** pane that opens, your billing account ID appears as a GUID value. That's your commerce account ID.
    - Company name and address, as registered under VAT or government website.
    - Company website.
    - Country/region.
    - Tax ID or VAT ID.
    - Year when the company was established.
    - Any prior business with Microsoft.
    - Contact name, phone, and email. You must add your billing contact information in the Azure portal before the credit limit can be approved. The contact details should be related to the company's Accounts Payable or Finance department.
    - Justification for why you want to use wire transfer instead of a credit card for payment.
    - File upload. Attach legal documentation that shows the company name and company address. Your information in the Azure portal (that is, the information for the Azure account) should match the legal information registered in the legal document. You can provide one of the following examples:
      - A certificate of incorporation signed by the company's legal representatives.
      - Any government-issued document that has the company name and address, such as a tax certification.
      - A company registration form signed and issued by the government.

      To view or update your company name or company address, see [Change your Azure account profile information](change-azure-account-profile.yml).
    - For an increase in cores, provide the following information:
        - Existing cores (old quota).
        - Requested cores (new quota).
        - Specific region and series of your subscription.
1. Verify your contact information and preferred contact method, and then select **Create**.

If we need to run a credit check because of the amount of credit that you need, we'll send you a credit check application. We might ask you to provide your company's audited financial statements. We might also ask for a security deposit or a standby letter of credit to approve your credit check request. We ask for them when:

- We didn't receive financial information.
- The information isn't strong enough to support the requested amount of credit.
