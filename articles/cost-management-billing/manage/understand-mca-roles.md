# Understand Microsoft Customer Agreement administrative roles in Azure

To manage your billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement, use the roles described in the following sections. These roles are in addition to the built-in roles Azure has to control access to resources. For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md).

This article applies to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

Watch the [Manage access to your MCA billing account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sqglBlKkho) video to learn how you can control access to your Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account.

## Billing account roles and tasks

A billing account is created when you sign up to use Azure. You use your billing account to manage invoices, payments, and track costs. Roles on the billing account have the highest level of permissions and users in these roles get visibility into the cost and billing information for your entire account. Assign these roles only to users that need to view invoices, and track costs for your entire account like member of the finance and the accounting teams. For more information, see [Understand billing account](../understand/mca-overview.md#your-billing-account).

The following tables show what role you need to complete tasks in the context of the billing account.

>[!NOTE]
> The Global Administrator role is above the Billing Account Administrator. Global Administrators in a Microsoft Entra ID tenant can add or remove themselves as Billing Account Administrators at any time to the Microsoft Customer Agreement. For more information about elevating access, see [Elevate access to manage billing accounts](elevate-access-global-admin.md).

## Billing profile roles and tasks

Each billing account has at least one billing profile. Your first billing profile is set up when you sign up to use Azure. A monthly invoice is generated for the billing profile and contains all its associated charges from the prior month. You can set up more billing profiles based on your needs. Users with roles on a billing profile can view cost, set budget, and manage and pay its invoices. Assign these roles to users who are responsible for managing budget and paying invoices for the billing profile like members of the business administration teams in your organization. 

For more information, see [Understand billing profiles](../understand/mca-overview.md#billing-profiles).

For more information about assigning access for users, see  [Access of enterprise administrators, department administrators, and account owners on invoice sections](mca-setup-account.md#access-of-enterprise-administrators-department-administrators-and-account-owners-on-invoice-sections).

## Invoice section roles and tasks

Each billing profile contains one invoice section by default. You can create more invoice sections to group cost on the billing profile's invoice. Users with roles on an invoice section can control who creates Azure subscriptions and make other purchases. Assign these roles to users who set up Azure environment for teams in our organization like engineering leads and technical architects. For more information, see [Understand invoice section](../understand/mca-overview.md#invoice-sections).

The following tables show what role you need to complete tasks in the context of invoice sections.

## Manage billing roles in the Azure portal

To assign billing roles, you might need to use a specific navigation path in the Azure portal. For example, to assign the subscription creator role, navigate to the invoice section and select it first and then select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.  
   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/understand-mca-roles/billing-search-cost-management-billing.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Azure portal search." lightbox="./media/understand-mca-roles/billing-search-cost-management-billing.png":::
3. Select **Access control (IAM)** at a scope such as billing account, billing profile, invoice section, or subscription where you want to give access.
4. The Access control (IAM) page lists users and groups that are assigned to each role for that scope.  
   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/understand-mca-roles/billing-list-admins.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows list of admins for billing account." lightbox="./media/understand-mca-roles/billing-list-admins.png":::
5. To give access to a user, Select **+ Add** at the top of the page. On the Add role assignment page, select a role. Search for the user, group, or app to whom you want to give access. Select **Add** to assign the role.  
   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/understand-mca-roles/billing-add-admin.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows adding an admin to a billing account." lightbox="./media/understand-mca-roles/billing-add-admin.png":::
6. To remove access for a user, select the user with the role assignment you want to remove. At the top of the page, select **Remove**.  
   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/understand-mca-roles/billing-remove-admin.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows removing an admin from a billing account." lightbox="./media/understand-mca-roles/billing-remove-admin.png":::
