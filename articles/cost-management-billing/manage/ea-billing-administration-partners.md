# EA billing administration for partners in the Azure portal

This article explains the common tasks that a partner administrator accomplishes in the Azure portal https://portal.azure.com to manage indirect EAs. An indirect EA is one where a customer signs an agreement with a Microsoft partner. The partner administrator manages their indirect EAs on behalf of their customers.

You can watch the [EA Billing administration in the Azure portal for Partners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeZrVF6SXmso87z4YJ5KKrCCYMuiK47d0) series of videos on YouTube.

## Access the Azure portal

The partner organization is referred to as the **billing account** in the Azure portal. Partner administrators can sign in to the Azure portal to view and manage their partner organization. The partner organization contains their customer's enrollments. However, the partner doesn't have an enrollment of their own. A customer's enrollment is shown in the Azure portal as a **billing profile**.

A partner administrator user can have access to multiple partner organizations (billing account scopes). All the information and activity in the Azure portal are in the context of a billing account _scope_. It's important that the partner administrator first selects a billing scope and then does administrative tasks in the context of the selected scope.

### Select a billing scope

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_GTM/ModernBillingMenuBlade/AllBillingScopes).
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing** and select it.

1. In the left navigation menu, select **Billing scopes** and then select the billing account that you want to work with.

## Manage a partner organization

Partner administrator users can view and manage the partner organization. After a partner administrator selects a partner organization billing scope from Cost management + Billing, they see the Partner management overview page where they can view the following information:

- Partner organization details such as name, ID, and authentication setting
- List of active and extended enrollments and the option to download details
- List of enrollments expiring in the next 180 days, so that partner admin can act to renew
- List of enrollments with other status

The partner administrator uses the left navigation menu items to perform the following tasks:

- **Access control (IAM)** – To add, edit, and delete partner administrator users.
- **Billing profiles** – To view a list of enrollments.
- **Billing scopes** – To view a list of all billing scopes that they have access to.
- **New support request** – To create new support request.

## Manage partner administrators

Every partner administrator in the Azure portal can add or remove other partner administrators. Partner administrators are associated with partner organizations billing account. They aren't associated _directly_ with the enrollments.

Partners can view all the details of the billing account and billing profiles for indirect enrollments. The partner administrator can perform the following write operations.

- Update the billing account authentication type
- Add, edit, and delete another partner administrator user
- Set the markup of the billing profile for indirect enrollments
- Update the PO number of the billing profile for indirect enrollments
- Generate API the key of billing profile for indirect enrollments

A partner administrator with read-only access can view all billing account and billing profiles details. However, they can't perform any write operations.
