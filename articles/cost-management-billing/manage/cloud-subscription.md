# What is a cloud subscription?

A cloud subscription is a way to manage the products and services that you buy from Microsoft. Cloud subscriptions get created when you acquire Azure resources and sometimes when you get products outside of Azure services. For example, they include the Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment benefit, some Microsoft 365 subscriptions, and benefits like Enterprise Support.

The term cloud subscription is synonymous with Azure subscription.

- **No cost for cloud subscriptions** - Cloud subscriptions themselves don't cost any money. They're used to organize and manage the things you buy. While products like virtual machines or Enterprise Support managed within a cloud subscription might incur charges, the subscription itself doesn't.
- **Multiple subscriptions** - You can create multiple cloud subscriptions to delegate management to different users in your organization or to apply policies for security, budgeting, and compliance.
- **Familiar management tools** - If you used Azure subscriptions before, you can manage cloud subscriptions similarly, with more manageability for a broader set of products and services.
