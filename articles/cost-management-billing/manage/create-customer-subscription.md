## Permission required to create Azure subscriptions

You need the following permissions to create customer subscriptions:

    Make sure you are in your Partner Center directory (tenant), not a customer’s tenant.
1.	Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing**.
1.	Select the Billing scope for your billing account where the customer account resides.
1.	In the left menu under **Billing**, select **Customers**.
