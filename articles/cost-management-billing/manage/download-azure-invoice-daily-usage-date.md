# Download or view your Azure billing invoice

For most subscriptions, you can download your invoice from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) or have it sent in email. 

Azure EA customers can download their organization's invoices using the information at [Download or view your Azure billing invoice](direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices.md#download-or-view-your-azure-billing-invoice).

Only certain roles have permission to get billing invoice, like the Account Administrator or Enterprise Administrator. To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](manage-billing-access.md).

If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you must be a billing profile Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager to view billing information. To learn more about billing roles for Microsoft Customer Agreements, see [Billing profile roles and tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#billing-profile-roles-and-tasks).

### Download invoices for a Microsoft Customer Agreement

Invoices are generated for each [billing profile](../understand/mca-overview.md#billing-profiles) in the Microsoft Customer Agreement. You must be a billing profile Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager to download invoices from the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> VAT taxes shown on your invoice might have imprecise decimal point rounding that results in tax that's under or overcharged. For more information, see [What is the Modern Limited Risk Distributor model?](../understand/mca-understand-your-invoice.md#what-is-the-modern-limited-risk-distributor-model)

1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.
2. Select a billing profile.
3. Select **Invoices**.
4. In the invoice grid, find the row of the invoice you want to download.
5. Select the download symbol at the end of the row.
6. In the download context menu, select **Invoice**.

If you don't see an invoice for the last billing period, see the following section.

### <a name="noinvoice"></a> Why don't I see an invoice for the last billing period?

There could be several reasons that you don't see an invoice:

- It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure.
- The invoice isn't generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period.
- You don't have permission to view invoices. If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you must be the billing profile Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager. For other subscriptions, you might not see old invoices if you aren't the Account Administrator. To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](manage-billing-access.md).
- If you have a Free Trial or a monthly credit amount with your subscription that you didn't exceed, you won't get an invoice unless you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement.

## Get your invoice in email (.pdf)

You can opt in and configure other recipients to receive your Azure invoice in an email. This feature isn't available for certain subscriptions such as support offers, Enterprise Agreements, or Azure in Open. If you have a Microsoft Customer agreement, see [Get your billing profile invoices in email](../understand/download-azure-invoice.md#get-your-billing-profiles-invoice-in-email).

### Get your subscription's invoices in email

1. Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade). Opt in for each subscription you own. Select **Invoices** then **Email my invoice**.

3. Once you've accepted the agreement, you can configure other recipients. When a recipient is removed, the email address is no longer stored. If you change your mind, you need to readd them.
