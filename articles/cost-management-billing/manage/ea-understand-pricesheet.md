# Terms in your Enterprise Agreement price sheet

This article applies to an Azure billing account for an Enterprise Agreement (EA). [Check if you have access to Enterprise Agreement](#check-access-to-an-enterprise-agreement).

Depending on the policies set for your organization by the Enterprise Admin, only certain administrative roles provide access to your organization's EA pricing information. For more information, see [Understand Azure Enterprise Agreement administrative roles in Azure](understand-ea-roles.md).

For billing periods January 2023 onwards, a new version of the Azure price sheet is available for download. The new version features a new schema. It's a .ZIP file to support large amounts of data.

Azure reservation pricing is available in the Azure Price Sheet for the current billing period. If you want to maintain an ongoing record of Azure reservation pricing, we recommend that you download your Azure Price Sheet for each billing period.

## Terms and descriptions in your price sheet

The following section describes the terms shown in your Microsoft Enterprise Agreement price sheet.

| **Field Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| BasePrice | The unit price at the time the customer signs the agreement. Or, the unit price at the time that the service meter becomes generally available (GA) if GA is after the agreement is signed. |
| CurrencyCode | Currency in which the EA was signed. |
| EffectiveEndDate | Effective end date of the price sheet. |
| EffectiveStartDate | Effective start date of the price sheet. |
| IncludedQuantity | Quantities of a specific service to which a customer is entitled to consume without incremental charges. |
| MarketPrice | The current list price for a given product or service. The price is without any negotiations and is based on your Microsoft Agreement type. For `PriceType` _Consumption_, marketPrice is reflected as the pay-as-you-go price. For `PriceType`  _Savings Plan_, market price reflects the Savings plan benefit on top of pay-as-you-go price for the corresponding commitment term. For `PriceType` _ReservedInstance_, marketPrice reflects the total price of the one or three-year commitment. For EA customers with no negotiations, MarketPrice might appear rounded to a different decimal precision than UnitPrice.  |
| MeterId | Unique identifier for the meter. |
| MeterCategory | Name of the classification category for the meter. For example, _Cloud services_, and _Networking_. |
| MeterName | Name of the meter. The meter represents the deployable resource of an Azure service. |
| MeterSubCategory | Name of the meter subclassification category. |
| MeterRegion | Name of the region where the meter for the service is available. Identifies the location of the datacenter for certain services that are priced based on datacenter location. |
| MeterType | Name of the meter type. |
| OfferID | Offer ID associated with the meter. |
| PartNumber | Part number associated with the meter. |
| priceType | Price type for a product. For example, an Azure resource has its pay-as-you-go rate with `priceType` as _Consumption_. If the resource is eligible for a savings plan, it also has its savings plan rate with another priceType as _SavingsPlan_. Other `priceTypes` include _ReservedInstance_. |
| Product | Name of the product accruing the charges. For example, Basic SQL DB vs Standard SQL DB. |
| ProductID | Unique identifier for the product whose meter is consumed. |
| ServiceFamily | Type of Azure service. For example, Compute, Analytics, and Security. |
| SkuID | Unique identifier of the SKU. |
| Term | Duration associated with priceType. For example, _SavingsPlan_ `priceType` has two commitment options: one year and three years. The term is _P1Y_ for a one-year commitment and _P3Y_ for a three-year commitment. |
| UnitOfMeasure | Identifies the units of measure for billing for the service. For example, compute services are billed per hour. |
| UnitPrice | The per-unit price at the time of billing for a given product or service. It includes any negotiated discounts on top of the market price. For `PriceType` *ReservedInstance*, `unitPrice` reflects the total cost of the one or three-year commitment including discounts. **Note**: The unit price isn't the same as the effective price in usage details downloads when services have differential prices across tiers. If services have multi-tiered pricing, the effective price is a blended rate across the tiers and doesn't show a tier-specific unit price. The blended price or effective price is the net price for the consumed quantity spanning across the multiple tiers, where each tier has a specific unit price. |
