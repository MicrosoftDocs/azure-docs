## Understand the invoice file

Your invoice is a PDF file that contains at least two pages.

The second page lists the individual products in your order.

### Invoice terms

On the top of page one, you'll find the summary with the following fields:

**Invoice** – The number is a unique number generated by Microsoft that identifies your spending for the corresponding billing period.

**Invoice Date** - The date Microsoft created the invoice.
