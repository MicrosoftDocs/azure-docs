# Update tax details for an Azure billing account

When you buy Azure products and services, the taxes that you pay get determined by one of two things: your sold-to address, or your ship-to/service usage address, if it's different. 

This article helps you review and update the sold to information, ship-to/service usage address, and tax IDs for your Azure billing account. The instructions to update vary by the billing account type. For more information about billing accounts and how to identify your billing account type, see [View billing accounts in Azure portal](view-all-accounts.md). An Azure billing account is separate from your Azure user account and [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> - When you update the sold-to information, ship-to address, and tax IDs in the Azure portal, the updated values are only used for invoices that are generated in the future. To make changes to an existing invoice, [create a support request](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083458).
> - Microsoft doesn't regenerate past invoices to update sold-to information due to tax implications. Sold-to information on past invoices can't get updated.


## Update the sold to address

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using the email address with an owner or a contributor role on the billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA). Or, sign in with an account administrator role for a Microsoft Online Subscription Program (MOSP) billing account. MOSP is also referred to as pay-as-you-go.
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.

1. Enter the new address and select **Save**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Some accounts require extra verification before their sold-to can be updated. If your account requires manual approval, you're prompted to contact Azure support.

## Update ship-to address for an MCA billing account

Customers in Canada, Puerto Rico, and the United States can set the ship-to address for their MCA billing accounts. Each billing profile in their account can have its own ship-to address. To use multiple ship-to addresses, create multiple billing profiles, one for each ship-to address.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using the email address with an owner or a contributor role for the billing account or a billing profile for an MCA.
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.
1. In the left menu under **Billing**, select **Billing profiles**.
1. Select a billing profile to update the ship-to address.

1. Enter the new address and then select **Save**.

## Update ship-to address for a MOSP billing account

Customers with a Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP) account, also called pay-as-you-go, can set ship-to address for their billing account. Each subscription in their account can have its own ship-to address. To use multiple ship-to addresses, create multiple subscriptions, one for each ship-to address.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using the email address that has account administrator permission on the account.
1. Search for **Subscriptions**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-tax-information/search-subscriptions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to search for Subscriptions in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/manage-tax-information/search-subscriptions.png" :::
