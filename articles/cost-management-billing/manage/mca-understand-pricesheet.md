## Terms and descriptions in your price sheet

The following section describes the important terms shown in your Microsoft Customer Agreement price sheet.

| **Field Name**   | **Description**   |

| billingAccountId  | Unique identifier for the billing account.   |
| billingAccountName  | Name of the billing account.  |
| billingCurrency | Currency in which charges are posted |
| billingProfileId  | Unique identifier for the billing profile.   |

| effectiveStartDate  | Start date of the price sheet billing period. |
| includedQuantity | Quantities of a specific service to which a customer is entitled to consume without incremental charges. Not available in the updated version of the price sheet. |
| marketPrice | The current list price for a given product or service. The price is without any negotiations and is based on your Microsoft Agreement type. For `PriceType` _Consumption_, marketPrice is reflected as the pay-as-you-go price. For `PriceType`  _Savings Plan_, market price reflects the Savings plan benefit on top of pay-as-you-go price for the corresponding commitment term. For `PriceType` _ReservedInstance_, marketPrice reflects the total price of the one or three-year commitment. |
| meterId  | Unique identifier for the meter. |
| meterCategory  | Name of the classification category for the meter. For example, _Cloud services_, and _Networking_ |
| meterName  | Name of the meter. The meter represents the deployable resource of an Azure service. |
| meterSubCategory  | Name of the meter subclassification category.  |
| meterType  |  Name of the meter type. |
| meterRegion  | Name of the region where the meter for the service is available. Identifies the location of the datacenter for certain services that are priced based on datacenter location.    |
| priceType | Price type for a product. For example, an Azure resource has its pay-as-you-go rate with `priceType` as *Consumption*. If the resource is eligible for a savings plan, it also has its savings plan rate with another `priceType` as *SavingsPlan*. Other `priceTypes` include *ReservedInstance*. |
| Product  | Name of the product accruing the charges. For example, Basic SQL DB vs Standard SQL DB.  |
| productId  | Unique identifier for the product whose meter is consumed. |
| productOrderName  | Name of the purchased product plan. Not applicable for price sheets dated December 2022 and later.|
| serviceFamily  | Type of Azure service. For example, Compute, Analytics, and Security. |
| SkuID | Unique identifier of the SKU. |
| Term | Duration associated with `priceType`. For example, SavingsPlan priceType has two commitment options: one year and three years. The Term is *P1Y* for a one-year commitment and *P3Y* for a three-year commitment.  |
| tierMinimumUnits  | Defines the lower bound of the tier range for which prices are defined. For example, if the range is 0 to 100, tierMinimumUnits would be 0.  |
| unitOfMeasure  | Identifies the units of measure for billing for the service. For example, compute services are billed per hour. |
| unitPrice  | The per-unit price at the time of billing for a given product or service. It includes any negotiated discounts on top of the market price. For `PriceType` *ReservedInstance*, `unitPrice` reflects the total cost of the one or three-year commitment including discounts. **Note**: The unit price isn't the same as the effective price in usage details downloads when services have differential prices across tiers. If services have multi-tiered pricing, the effective price is a blended rate across the tiers and doesn't show a tier-specific unit price. The blended price or effective price is the net price for the consumed quantity spanning across the multiple tiers, where each tier has a specific unit price.|
