  - name: Partner questions
    questions:
      - question: Who should link the partner ID?
        answer: |
          Any user from the partner organization who works on a customer's Power Apps resources can link the partner ID to the account. Ideally, the association in PAL should be done at the beginning of the project. However, it can be performed whenever you have access to the customer's directory.
      - question: Can a partner ID be changed after it gets linked?
        answer: |
          Yes. A linked partner ID can be changed, added, or removed. For example, if an employee from your company leaves your organization, or when a project or contract with the customer ends.
      - question: What if a user has an account in more than one customer tenant?
        answer: |
          The link between the partner ID and the account is created for each customer tenant. Link the partner ID in each customer tenant.
      - question: Can other partners or customers edit or remove the link to the partner ID?
        answer: |
          The link is associated at the user account level. Only you can edit or remove the link to the partner ID. The customer and other partners can't change the link to the partner ID.
      - question: Which Partner ID should I use if my company has multiple?
        answer: |
          Be sure to use the **Associated Partner ID** shown in your partner profile. It's usually the local account ID associated with your organization.
      - question: How do I explain PAL to my customer?
        answer: |
          PAL enables Microsoft to identify and recognize those partners who help customers achieve business goals and realize value in the cloud. Customers must first provide a partner access to their Power Apps resource. Once access is granted, the partner's Partner ID is associated. This association helps Microsoft understand service providers and refine the tools and programs needed to best support customers.
      - question: What data does PAL collect?
        answer: |
          The PAL association to existing credentials provides no new customer data to Microsoft. It provides information to Microsoft about where a partner is actively involved in a customer's Power Apps environments. Microsoft can attribute usage and influence from the customer environment to the partner organization based on the account's permissions (Power Apps role) and scope (tenant, Resource Group, Resource) provided to the partner by the customer.
      - question: Does PAL association affect the security of a customer's Power Apps environment?
        answer: |
          PAL association only adds the partner's Partner ID to the credential already provisioned. It doesn't alter any permissions (Power Apps role) or provide extra Power Apps service data to the partner or Microsoft.
