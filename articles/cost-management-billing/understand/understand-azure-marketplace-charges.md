# Understand your Azure external services charges
Third-party software vendors in the Azure Marketplace publish external services. For example, SendGrid is an external service that you can purchase in Azure, but Microsoft doesn't publish it. Some Microsoft products are sold through Azure Marketplace, too.

## How external services are billed

- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) or Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), your third-party services are billed with the rest of your Azure services. [Check your billing account type](#check-billing-account-type) to see if you have access to an MCA or MPA.
- If you don't have an MCA or MPA, your external services are billed separately from your Azure services. You receive two invoices each billing period: one invoice for Azure services and another for Marketplaces purchases.
- Each external service has a different billing model. Some services are billed in a pay-as-you-go fashion while others have monthly charges that are fixed.
- You can't use monthly free credits for external services. If you're using an Azure subscription that includes [free credits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/), they can't be applied to charges from external services. When you provision a new external service or resource, a warning is shown. You can choose to continue with the provisioning or cancel it.

## External spending for EA customers

EA customers can see external service spending in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). To view and download Azure Marketplace charges, navigate to the **Usage + charges** menu.

## View and download invoices for external services

If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) or Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), your third-party services are billed with the rest of your Azure services on a single invoice. [Check your billing account type](#check-billing-account-type) to see if you have access to an MCA or MPA. If you do, see [View and download invoices in the Azure portal](download-azure-invoice.md) to see your third-party charges.

If you don't have an MCA or MPA, you have separate invoices for third-party charges. 

Azure Marketplace charges are shown in your local currency.

You can view and download your Azure Marketplace invoices from the Azure portal by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.
1. In the left menu, select **Invoices**.
1. In the subscription drop-down, select the subscription associated with your Marketplace services.
1. Review the **Type** column in the list of invoices. If an invoice is for a Marketplace service, the type is **Azure Marketplace and Reservations**.

## Pay for external services in the Azure portal

If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) or Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), your third-party services are billed with the rest of your Azure services.

If you do, you can pay for your entire invoice in the Azure portal by following the steps in [Pay your bill for Microsoft Azure](pay-bill.md).

If you don't have an MCA or MPA, you can pay for your Marketplace invoices in the Azure portal by following these steps:

## Change default payment for external services

    :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/understand-azure-marketplace-charges/sub-selected.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the subscription name for resource.":::
1. Select the subscription name and [update the active payment method](../manage/change-credit-card.md).

## Cancel an external service order

If you want to cancel your external service order, delete the resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
