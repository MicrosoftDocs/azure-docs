# Azure billing meter ID updates

On March 1, 2024, some Azure billing meters were updated for improved meter ID metadata. More updates are underway. A billing meter is used to determine the cost of using a specific service or resource in Azure. It helps calculate the amount you're charged based on the quantity of the resource consumed. The billing meter varies depending on the type of service or resource used.

The meter ID updates result in having only individual unique meters. A unique meter means that every Azure service, resource, and region has its own billing meter ID that precisely reflects its consumption and price. The change ensures that you see the correct meter ID on your invoice, and that you’re charged the correct price for each service or resource consumed.

*The meter ID changes don’t affect prices*. However, you might notice some changes in how your Azure consumption is shown on your invoice, price sheet, API, usage details file, and Cost Management + Billing experiences.

Here’s an example showing updated meter information.

## Recommendations

We recommend you review the list of updated meters and familiarize yourself with the new meter IDs and names that apply to your Azure consumption. You should check reports that you have  for analysis, budgets, and any saved views to see if they use the updated meters. If so, you might need to update them accordingly for the new meter IDs and names. If you don’t use any meters in the updated meters list, the changes don’t affect you.
