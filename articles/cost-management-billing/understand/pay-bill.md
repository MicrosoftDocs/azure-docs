# How to pay your bill for Microsoft Azure

This article applies to customers with a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA).

[Check your access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

There are two ways to pay for your bill for Azure. You can pay with the default payment method of your billing profile or you can make a one-time payment called **Pay now**.

If you signed up for Azure through a Microsoft representative, then your default payment method will always be set to *check or wire transfer*.

If you have Azure credits, they automatically apply to your invoice each billing period.

## Pay by default payment method

The default payment method of your billing profile can either be a credit or debit card, or a check or wire transfer.

### Credit or debit card

If the default payment method for your billing profile is a credit or debit card, it's automatically charged each billing period.

If your automatic credit or debit card charge gets declined for any reason, you can make a one-time payment with a credit or debit card in the Azure portal using **Pay now**.

If you want to learn how to change your default payment method to check or wire transfer, see [How to pay by invoice](../manage/pay-by-invoice.md).

### Check or wire transfer

If the default payment method of your billing profile is check or wire transfer, follow the payment instructions shown on your invoice PDF file.

Alternatively, if your invoice is under the threshold amount for your currency, you can make a one-time payment in the Azure portal with a credit or debit card using **Pay now**. If your invoice amount exceeds the threshold, you can't pay your invoice with a credit or debit card. You'll find the threshold amount for your currency in the Azure portal after selecting **Pay now**.

## Pay now in the Azure portal

To pay invoices in the Azure portal, you must have the correct [MCA permissions](../manage/understand-mca-roles.md) or be the Billing Account admin. The Billing Account admin is the user who originally signed up for the MCA account.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search on **Cost Management + Billing**.
1. In the left menu, select **Invoices** under **Billing**.
1. If any of your invoices are due or past due, you'll see a blue **Pay now** link for that invoice. Select **Pay now**.
1. In the Pay now window, select **Select a payment method** to choose an existing credit card or add a new one.
1. After you select a payment method, select **Pay now**.

The invoice status shows *paid* within 24 hours.

## Pay now for customers in India

The Reserve Bank of India issued [new regulations](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12002&Mode=0) that will take effect on April 1st 2021. After this date, banks in India may start declining automatic recurring payments, and payments will need to be made manually in the Azure portal.

If your bank declines an automatic recurring payment, we’ll notify you via email and provide instructions on how to proceed.

Beginning April 1st 2021, you may pay an outstanding balance any time by following these steps: 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as the Account Administrator.
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.
1. On the Overview page, select the **Pay now** button. (If you don't see the **Pay now** button, you do not have an outstanding balance.)
