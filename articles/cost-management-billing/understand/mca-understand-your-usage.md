# Terms in the Azure usage and charges file for a Microsoft Customer Agreement

This article applies to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

The Azure usage and charges CSV file contain daily and meter-level usage charges for the current billing period.

To get your Azure usage and charges file, see [View and download Azure usage and charges for your Microsoft Customer Agreement](download-azure-daily-usage.md). It's available in a comma-separated values (.csv) file format that you can open in a spreadsheet application.

Usage charges are the total **monthly** charges on a subscription. The usage charges don't take into account any credits or discounts.

## Detailed terms and descriptions

If you want to see a list of all available terms in the MCA usage file, see [Understand cost details data fields](../automate/understand-usage-details-fields.md).

### Make sure that charges are correct

If you want to make sure that the charges in your detailed usage file are correct, you can verify them. See [Understand the charges on your billing profile's invoice](review-customer-agreement-bill.md)

## Changes from Azure EA usage and charges

If you're an EA customer, notice that the terms in the Azure billing profile usage CSV file differ from the terms in the Azure EA usage CSV file. Here's a mapping of EA usage terms to billing profile usage terms:

| ResourceRate | effectivePrice | The price represents the actual rate that you end up paying per unit, after discounts are taken into account. It's the price that should be used with the `Quantity` to do `Price` \* `Quantity` calculations to reconcile charges. The price takes into account the following scenarios and the scaled unit price that's also present in the files. As a result, it might differ from the scaled unit price. <br> [Reservation](../reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage-ea.md) and [savings plan](../savings-plan/utilization-cost-reports.md) charges might be zero in actual cost reports but are shown in amortized cost reports. |
