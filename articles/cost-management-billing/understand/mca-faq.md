## What exchange rate will be used and how does it work with my bill?

We use Thomson Reuters benchmark rates that are captured at the end of the previous month and go into effect on the first day of the next calendar month. This rate applies to all transactions during the upcoming month.

For example, the exchange rate for January transactions is first captured in the final days of December. This rate will be applied to all Azure purchases made in January and all Azure consumption in January. The January exchange rate and local currency billed amount will appear in the January invoice, which is available at the beginning of February.

## Under the Microsoft Customer Agreement, in which currency will my payment be processed?

The legal address you provide at the time of signing will determine your billing geography and currency based on the table below:
