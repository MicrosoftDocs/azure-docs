# View and download your Microsoft Azure invoice

You can download your invoice in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or get it sent in email. Invoices are sent to the person set to receive invoices for the enrollment.

If you're an Azure customer with an Enterprise Agreement (EA customer), only an EA administrator can download and view your organization's invoice. Direct EA administrators can [Download or view their Azure billing invoice](../manage/direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices.md#download-or-view-your-azure-billing-invoice). Indirect EA administrators can use the information at [Azure Enterprise enrollment invoices](../manage/direct-ea-billing-invoice-documents.md) to download their invoice.

## Where invoices are generated

An invoice is generated based on your billing account type. Invoices are created for Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP) also called pay-as-you-go, Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), and Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) billing accounts. Invoices are also generated for Enterprise Agreement (EA) billing accounts.

To learn more about billing accounts and identify your billing account type, see [View billing accounts in Azure portal](../manage/view-all-accounts.md).

### Invoice status

When you review your invoice status in the Azure portal, each invoice has one of the following status symbols.

|  Status symbol | Description  |
|---|---|
| :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/download-azure-invoice/due.svg" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Due status symbol."::: | *Due* is displayed when an invoice is generated, but not yet paid. |
| :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/download-azure-invoice/past-due.svg" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Past due status symbol.":::  | *Past due* is displayed when Azure tried to charge your payment method, but the payment was declined. |
| :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/download-azure-invoice/paid.svg" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Paid status symbol.":::  | *Paid* status is displayed when Azure successfully charged your payment method. |

When an invoice is created, it appears in the Azure portal with *Due* status. Due status is normal and expected.  

When an invoice wasn't paid, its status is shown as *Past due*. A past due subscription gets disabled if the invoice isn't paid.

## Invoices for MOSP billing accounts

An MOSP billing account is created when you sign up for Azure through the Azure website. For example, when you sign up for an [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/), [account with pay-as-you-go rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) or as a [Visual Studio subscriber](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/).

Customers in select regions, who sign up through the Azure website for an [account with pay-as-you-go rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) or an [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) can have a billing account for an MCA.

If you're unsure of your billing account type, see [Check your billing account type](../manage/view-all-accounts.md#check-the-type-of-your-account) before following the instructions in this article. 

An MOSP billing account can have the following invoices:

**Azure service charges** - An invoice is generated for each Azure subscription that contains Azure resources used by the subscription. The invoice contains charges for a billing period. The billing period gets determined by the day of the month when the subscription is created.

For example, a billing administrator creates *Azure sub 01* on 5 March and *Azure sub 02* on 10 March. The invoice for *Azure sub 01* will have charges from the fifth day of a month to the fourth day of next month. The invoice for *Azure sub 02* will have charges from the tenth day of a month to the ninth day of next month. The invoices for all Azure subscriptions are normally generated on the day of the month that the account was created but can be up to two days later. In this example, if the billing administrator created their account on 2 February, the invoices for both *Azure sub 01* and *Azure sub 02* will normally be generated on the second day of each month. However, it could be up to two days later.

**Azure Marketplace, reservations, and spot VMs** - An invoice is generated for reservations, marketplace products, and spot VMs purchased using a subscription. The invoice shows respective charges from the previous month. For example, John purchased a reservation on 1 March and another reservation on 30 March. A single invoice is generated for both the reservations in April. The invoice for Azure Marketplace, reservations, and spot VMs are always generated around the ninth day of the month.

If you pay for Azure with a credit card and you buy reservation, Azure generates an immediate invoice. However, when billed by an invoice, you're charged for the reservation on your next monthly invoice.

**Azure support plan** - An invoice is generated each month for your support plan subscription. The first invoice is generated on the day of purchase or up to two days later. Later support plan invoices are normally generated on the same day of the month that the account was created but could be generated up to two days later.

## Download your MOSP Azure subscription invoice

An invoice is only generated for a subscription that belongs to a billing account for an MOSP. [Check your access to an MOSP account](../manage/view-all-accounts.md#check-the-type-of-your-account).

## Invoices for MCA and MPA billing accounts

An MCA billing account is created when your organization works with a Microsoft representative to sign an MCA. Some customers in select regions, who sign up through the Azure website for an [account with pay-as-you-go rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) or an [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) might have a billing account for an MCA as well. For more information, see [Get started with your MCA billing account](../understand/mca-overview.md).

An MPA billing account is created for Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners to manage their customers in the new commerce experience. Partners need to have at least one customer with an [Azure plan](/partner-center/purchase-azure-plan) to manage their billing account in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Get started with your MPA billing account](../understand/mpa-overview.md).

A monthly invoice is generated at the beginning of the month for each billing profile in your account. The invoice contains respective charges for all Azure subscriptions and other purchases from the previous month. For example, a subscription owner created *Azure sub 01* on 5 March, *Azure sub 02* on 10 March. They purchased *Azure support 01* subscription on 28 March using *Billing profile 01*. They get a single invoice in the beginning of April that contains charges for both Azure subscriptions and the support plan.

##  Download an MCA or MPA billing profile invoice

## Azure Government support for invoices

Azure Government users use the same agreement types as other Azure users.

Azure Government customers canâ€™t request their invoice by email. They can only download it.

To download your invoice, follow the previous steps at [Download your MOSP Azure subscription invoice](#download-your-mosp-azure-subscription-invoice).

##  Why you might not see an invoice

<a name="noinvoice"></a>

There could be several reasons that you don't see an invoice:

- The invoice isn't ready yet
    
    - It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure. 

    - Azure bills you a few days after the end of your billing period. So, an invoice might not be generated yet.

- You don't have permission to view invoices. 
    
    - If you have an MCA or MPA billing account, you must have an Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager role on a billing profile. Or, you must have an Owner, Contributor, or Reader role on the billing account to view invoices. 
    
    - For other billing accounts, you might not see the invoices if you aren't the Account Administrator.

- Your account doesn't support an invoice.

    - Under a Microsoft Online Services Program (MOSP) agreement, you receive an invoice only if your usage exceeds the monthly credit amount. This situation applies if you signed up for an Azure Free Account or have a subscription that includes a monthly credit.

    - If you have a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) or a Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), you always receive an invoice.

- You have access to the invoice through one of your other accounts.

    - This situation typically happens when you select a link in the email, asking you to view your invoice in the portal. You select the link and you see an error message - `We can't display your invoices. Please try again`. Verify that you're signed in with the email address that has permissions to view the invoices.

- You have access to the invoice through a different identity. 

    - Some customers have two identities with the same email address - a work account and a Microsoft account. Typically, only one of their identities has permissions to view invoices. If they sign in with the identity that doesn't have permission, they wouldn't see the invoices. Verify that you're using the correct identity to sign in.

- You signed in to the incorrect Microsoft Entra tenant. 

    - Your billing account is associated with a Microsoft Entra tenant. If you're signed in to an incorrect tenant, you don't see the invoice for subscriptions in your billing account. Verify that you're signed in to the correct Microsoft Entra tenant. If you aren't signed in the correct tenant, use the following to switch the tenant in the Azure portal:

        1. Select your email from the top right of the page.

        2. Select **Switch directory**.

           :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/download-azure-invoice/select-switch-directory.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Switch directory option in the Azure portal.":::

        3. Select **Switch** for a directory from the **All directories** section.
