# View and download tax documents for your Azure invoice

You can download tax documents for your Azure invoice if you have access to invoices in the Azure portal. Only certain roles have access to invoices, such as the Account Administrator. If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you must be a Billing profile Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager to download invoices and tax documents. If you have Microsoft Partner Agreement, you must have the Global Admin or Admin Agent role in the partner organization. [Check your billing account type](#check-billing-account-type) to see what permissions you need to download tax documents.

## View and download tax documents

1. Sign-in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for *Cost Management + Billing*.
1. Depending on your access, you might need to select a Billing account or Billing profile.
1. In the left menu, select **Invoices** under **Billing**.
1. In the invoice grid, find the row of the invoice corresponding to the tax document you want to download.
1. Click the download icon or the ellipsis (`...`) at the end of the row.
7. Select **Tax document** in the download menu. Depending on the country/region of your billing profile, you might see more than one tax document per invoice.
