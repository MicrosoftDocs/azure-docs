# Understand terms on your Microsoft Azure invoice

The invoice provides a summary of your charges and provides instructions for payment. It’s available for
download in the Portable Document Format (.pdf) from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or can be sent via email. For more
information, see [How to get your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data](../manage/download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date.md).

A few things to note:

-   If you're using a free trial subscription, you can get your detailed
    usage information from the Azure portal but you don't have an
    invoice.

-   Up to 24 hours of usage at the end of the previous billing period
    may show up in your current invoice.

-   Charges listed on billing statements for international customers are
    for estimation purposes only. Banks may have different costs for the
    conversion rates.
