# Terms in your Microsoft Partner Agreement invoice

This article applies to an Azure billing account for a Microsoft Partner Agreement. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Partner Agreement](#check-access-to-a-microsoft-partner-agreement).

Your invoice provides a summary of your charges and instructions for payment. Itâ€™s available for download in the Portable Document Format (.pdf) from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or can be sent via email. For more information, see [View and download your Microsoft Azure invoice](download-azure-invoice.md).

The following sections list important terms that you see on your invoice and provide descriptions for each term.

## Billing period

You are invoiced on a monthly basis. Charges that occur between the end of the billing period and the invoice date are included in the next month's invoice, since they are in the next billing period. The billing period start and end dates for each invoice are listed in the invoice PDF above **Billing Summary**.

## Invoice summary

The **Invoice Summary** is at the top of the first page and shows information about your billing profile and how you pay.
