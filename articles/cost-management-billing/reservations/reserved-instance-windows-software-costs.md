# Software costs not included with Azure Reserved VM Instances

Virtual machine reserved instance and SQL reserved capacity discounts apply only to the infrastructure costs and not to the software costs. If you use Windows VM and don't have an Azure Hybrid Benefit on your reserved virtual machine instances, then you're charged for the software meters listed in the following section. For SQL PaaS deployments, the IP cost continue to get charged using separate meter if Azure Hybrid Benefit isn't selected.
