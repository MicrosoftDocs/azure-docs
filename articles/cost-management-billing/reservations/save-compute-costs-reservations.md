# What are Azure Reservations?

Azure Reservations help you save money by committing to one-year or three-year plans for multiple products. Committing allows you to get a discount on the resources you use. Reservations can significantly reduce your resource costs by up to 72% from pay-as-you-go prices. Reservations provide a billing discount and don't affect the runtime state of your resources. After you purchase a reservation, the discount automatically applies to matching resources.

You can pay for a reservation up front or monthly. The total cost of up-front and monthly reservations is the same and you don't pay any extra fees when you choose to pay monthly. Monthly payments are for complete month and not proparted based on calendar month. As an example if you purchased a reservation on January 15, the next charge will be around February 15. Monthly payment is available for Azure reservations, not third-party products.

You can buy a reservation in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Reservations/ReservationsBrowseBlade).

## Why buy a reservation?

If you have consistent resource usage that supports reservations, buying a reservation gives you the option to reduce your costs. For example, when you continuously run instances of a service without a reservation, you're charged at pay-as-you-go rates. Once a reservation purchase is complete, you get the reservation discount. The resources are no longer charged at the pay-as-you-go rates.

## How reservation discount is applied

After purchase, the reservation discount automatically applies to the resource usage that matches the attributes you select when you buy the reservation. Attributes include the SKU, regions (where applicable), and scope. Reservation scope selects where the reservation savings apply.

For more information about how discount is applied, see [Reserved instance discount application](reservation-discount-application.md).

For more information about how reservation scope works, see [Scope reservations](prepare-buy-reservation.md#scope-reservations).

## Determine what to purchase 

All reservations, except Azure Databricks, are applied on an hourly basis. Consider reservation purchases based on your consistent base usage. You can determine which reservation to purchase by analyzing your usage data or by using reservation recommendations. Recommendations are available in:

- Azure Advisor (VMs only)
- Reservation purchase experience in the Azure portal
- Cost Management Power BI app
- APIs 

For more information, see [Determine what reservation to purchase](determine-reservation-purchase.md) 

## Buying a reservation 

You can purchase reservations from the Azure portal, APIs, PowerShell, and CLI. 

Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Reservations/CreateBlade/referrer/Docs) to make a purchase.

For more information, see [Buy a reservation](prepare-buy-reservation.md).

## How is a reservation billed? 

The reservation is charged to the payment method tied to the subscription. The reservation cost is deducted from your Azure Prepayment (previously called monetary commitment) balance, if available. When your Azure Prepayment balance doesn't cover the cost of the reservation, you're billed the overage. If you have a subscription from an individual plan with pay-as-you-go rates, the credit card you have on your account is billed immediately for up-front purchases. Monthly payments appear on your invoice and your credit card is charged monthly. When you're billed by invoice, you see the charges on your next invoice. 

## Who can manage a reservation by default

By default, the following users can view and manage reservations:

- The person who buys a reservation and the account administrator of the billing subscription used to buy the reservation are added to the reservation order.
- Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft Customer Agreement billing administrators.

To allow other people to manage reservations, see [Manage Reservations for Azure resources](manage-reserved-vm-instance.md).

## Get reservation details and utilization after purchase

If you have permission to view to the reservation, you can see it and its use in the Azure portal. You can get the data using APIs, as well. 

For more information on how to see reservations in Azure portal, see [View reservations in the Azure portal](view-reservations.md) 

## Manage reservations after purchase 

After you buy an Azure reservation, you can update the scope to apply reservation to a different subscription, change who can manage the reservation, split a reservation into smaller parts, or change instance size flexibility. 

For more information, see [Manage Reservations for Azure resources](manage-reserved-vm-instance.md) 

## Flexibility with Azure reservations

Azure Reservations provide flexibility to help meet your evolving needs. You can exchange a reservation for another reservation of the same type. You can also refund a reservation, up to $50,000 USD in a 12 month rolling window, if you no longer need it. The maximum limit of the refund applies to all reservations in the scope of your agreement with Microsoft.

For more information, see [Self-service exchanges and refunds for Azure Reservations](exchange-and-refund-azure-reservations.md)

- **Azure Synapse Analytics** - A reservation covers cDWU usage. It doesn't cover storage or networking charges associated with the Azure Synapse Analytics usage.
- **Azure Databricks** - A reservation covers only the DBU usage. Other charges, such as compute, storage, and networking, are applied separately.
- **App Service stamp fee** - A reservation covers stamp usage. It doesn't apply to workers, so any other resources associated with the stamp are charged separately.

- **Azure Backup Storage reserved capacity** - A capacity reservation lowers storage costs of backup data in a Recovery Services Vault.
- **Azure NetApp Files** - A capacity reservation covers matching capacity pools in the selected service level and region. When using capacity pools configured with [cool access](../../azure-netapp-files/manage-cool-access.md), only "hot" tier consumption is covered by the reservation benefit. 

Software plans:

- **SUSE Linux** - A reservation covers the software plan costs. The discounts apply only to SUSE meters and not to the virtual machine usage.
- **Red Hat Plans** (***plans and renewal are temporarily unavailable***) - A reservation covers the software plan costs. The discounts apply only to RedHat meters and not to the virtual machine usage.
- **Azure Red Hat OpenShift** - A reservation applies to the OpenShift costs, not to Azure infrastructure costs.

For Windows virtual machines and SQL Database, the reservation discount doesn't apply to the software costs. You can cover the licensing costs with [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/).
