They can use the cost data to charge back the monetary value for a subscription, resource group, resource, or a tag to their partners. In amortized data, the effective price is the prorated hourly reservation cost. The cost is the total cost of reservation usage by the resource on that day. Users with an individual subscription can get the amortized cost data from their usage file. For more information, see [Charge back Azure Reservation costs](charge-back-usage.md).

- To buy a reservation, you must have the owner role or reservation purchaser role on an Azure subscription that's of one of the following types:
  - Enterprise (MS-AZR-0017P or MS-AZR-0148P)
  - Pay-As-You-Go (MS-AZR-0003P or MS-AZR-0023P)
  - Microsoft Customer Agreement
- Cloud solution providers can use the Azure portal or [Partner Center](/partner-center/azure-reservations) to purchase Azure Reservations. You can't purchase a reservation if you have a custom role that mimics the owner role or reservation purchaser role on an Azure subscription. You must use the built-in owner or built-in reservation purchaser role.
- For more information about who can purchase a reservation, see [Buy an Azure reservation](prepare-buy-reservation.md).

**Offer details** - For Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance, you make a commitment for SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance use for one or three years to get a significant discount on the compute costs. To purchase reserved capacity, you need to specify the Azure region, deployment type, performance tier, and term.

You don't need to assign the reservation to a specific database or managed instance. Matching existing deployments that are already running or ones that are newly deployed automatically get the benefit. Hence, by purchasing a reserved capacity, existing resources infrastructure wouldn't be modified and thus no failover/downtime is triggered on existing resources. By purchasing a reservation, you commit to usage for the compute costs for one or three years. As soon as you buy a reservation, the compute charges that match the reservation attributes are no longer charged at the pay-as-you go rates.

For more information, see [Save compute costs with reserved capacity - Azure SQL Database & SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/database/reserved-capacity-overview).

For Azure Database for MySQL, you make an upfront commitment on MySQL server for a one or three year period to get a significant discount on the compute costs. To purchase Azure Database for MySQL reserved capacity, you need to specify the Azure region, deployment type, performance tier, and term.

You don't need to assign the reservation to specific Azure Database for MySQL servers. An already running Azure Database for MySQL or ones that are newly deployed, automatically get the benefit of reserved pricing. By purchasing a reservation, you're prepaying for the compute costs for one or three years. As soon as you buy a reservation, the Azure database for MySQL compute charges that match the reservation attributes are no longer charged at the pay-as-you go rates. A reservation doesn't cover software, networking, or storage charges associated with the MySQL Database server. At the end of the reservation term, the billing benefit expires. Azure Database for MySQL usage is then billed at the pay-as-you go price.

For more information, see [Prepay for compute with reserved capacity - Azure Database for MySQL](/azure/mysql/single-server/concept-reserved-pricing).

- Additional taxes might apply.
- Payment will be processed using the payment method on file for the selected subscriptions.
