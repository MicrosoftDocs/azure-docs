# Save costs with Azure App Service reserved instances

This article explains how you can save with Azure App Service reserved instances for Premium v3 and Isolated v2 instances and Isolated Stamp Fees.

## Save with Premium v3 reserved instances

When you commit to an Azure App Service Premium v3 reserved instance you can save money. The reservation discount is applied automatically to the number of running instances that match the reservation scope and attributes. You don't need to assign a reservation to an instance to get the discounts.

## Determine the right reserved instance size before you buy

Before you buy a reservation, you should determine the size of the Premium v3 reserved instance that you need. The following sections will help you determine the right Premium v3 reserved instance size.

### Use reservation recommendations

You can use reservation recommendations to help determine the reservations you should purchase.

- Purchase recommendations and recommended quantities are shown when you purchase a Premium v3 reserved instance in the Azure portal.
- Azure Advisor provides purchase recommendations for individual subscriptions.
- You can use the APIs to get purchase recommendations for both shared scope and single subscription scope.
- For Enterprise Agreement (EA) and Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) customers, purchase recommendations for shared and single subscription scopes are available with the [Azure Consumption Insights Power BI content pack](/power-bi/service-connect-to-azure-consumption-insights).

### Analyze your usage information

Analyze your usage information to help determine which reservations you should purchase. Usage data is available in the usage file and APIs. Use them together to determine which reservation to purchase. Check for Premium v3 instances that have high usage on daily basis to determine the quantity of reservations to purchase.

Your usage file shows your charges by billing period and daily usage. For information about downloading your usage file, see [View and download your Azure usage and charges](../understand/download-azure-daily-usage.md). Then, by using the usage file information, you can [determine what reservation to purchase](determine-reservation-purchase.md).

## Buy a Premium v3 reserved instance

You can buy a reserved Premium v3 reserved instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Reservations/CreateBlade/referrer/documentation/filters/%7B%22reservedResourceType%22%3A%22VirtualMachines%22%7D). Pay for the reservation [up front or with monthly payments](prepare-buy-reservation.md). These requirements apply to buying a Premium v3 reserved instance:

- To buy a reservation, you must have owner role or reservation purchaser role on an Azure subscription.
- For EA subscriptions, the **Reserved Instances** option must be enabled in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_GTM/ModernBillingMenuBlade/BillingAccounts). Navigate to the **Policies** menu to change settings.

To buy an instance:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **All services** > **Reservations**.
3. Select **Add** to purchase a new reservation and then select **Instance**.
4. Enter required fields. Running Premium v3 reserved instances that match the attributes you select qualify for the reservation discount. The actual number of your Premium v3 reserved instances that get the discount depend on the scope and quantity selected.

If you have an EA agreement, you can use the **Add more option** to quickly add additional instances. The option isn't available for other subscription types.

## Save with Isolated Stamp Fees

You can save money on Azure App Service Isolated Stamp Fees by committing to a reservation for your stamp usage for a duration of three years. To purchase Isolated Stamp Fee reserved capacity, you need to choose the Azure region where the stamp will be deployed and the number of stamps to purchase.

When you purchase a reservation, the Isolated Stamp Fee usage that matches the reservation attributes is no longer charged at the pay-as-you go rates. The reservation is applied automatically to the number of Isolated stamps that match the reserved capacity scope and region. You don't need to assign a reservation to an isolated stamp. The reservation doesn't apply to workers, so any other resources associated with the stamp are charged separately.

When the reserved capacity expires, Isolated Stamps continue to run but they're billed at the pay-as-you go rate. Reservations don't renew automatically.

## Determine the right Isolated Stamp reservation to purchase

By purchasing a reservation, you're committing to using reserved quantities over next three years. Check your usage data to determine how many App Service Isolated Stamps you're consistently using and might use in the future.

Additionally, make sure you understand how the Isolated Stamp emits Linux or Windows meter.

- By default, an empty Isolated Stamp emits the Windows stamp meter. For example, with no workers deployed. It continues to emit this meter if Windows workers are deployed on the stamp.
- The meter changes to the Linux stamp meter if you deploy a Linux worker.
- In cases where both Linux and Windows workers are deployed, the stamp emits the Windows meter.

So, the stamp meter can change between Windows and Linux over the life of the stamp.

Buy Windows stamp reservations if you have one or more Windows workers on the stamp. The only time you should purchase a Linux stamp reservation is if you plan to _only_ have Linux workers on the stamp.

## Buy Isolated Stamp reserved capacity
