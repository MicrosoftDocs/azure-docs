# FOCUS cost and usage details file schema

This article lists the cost details and usage (formerly known as usage details) fields found in the FOCUS cost and usage details file. The FOCUS version of the cost and usage details file uses columns, values, and semantics as they're defined in the [FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS) project](https://focus.finops.org/#specification). The file contains all of the same cost and usage data for the Microsoft Cloud services that got used or purchased as what you get in the actual and amortized files.

To learn more about FOCUS, see [FOCUS: A new specification for cloud cost transparency](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/focus-a-new-specification-for-cloud-cost-transparency).

## Changelog

You can view the latest changes to the FOCUS cost and usage details file schema in the [FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification changelog](https://github.com/FinOps-Open-Cost-and-Usage-Spec/FOCUS_Spec/blob/working_draft/CHANGELOG.md).

#### Note: Version 1.0r2

FOCUS 1.0r2 is a follow-up release to the FOCUS 1.0 dataset that changes how date columns are formatted, which may impact anyone who is parsing and especially modifying these values. The 1.0r2 dataset is still aligned with the FOCUS 1.0 specification. The "r2" indicates this is the second release of that 1.0 specification. The only change in this release is that all date columns now include seconds to more closely adhere to the FOCUS 1.0 specification. As an example, a 1.0 export may use "2024-01-01T00:00Z" and a 1.0r2 export would use "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z". The only difference is the extra ":00" for seconds at the end of the time segment of the ISO formatted date string.
