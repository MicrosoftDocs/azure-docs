| 12  | marketPrice | The current list price for a given product or service. The price is without any negotiations and is based on your Microsoft Agreement type. For PriceType _Consumption_, marketPrice is reflected as the pay-as-you-go price. For PriceType _Savings Plan_, market price reflects the Savings plan benefit on top of pay-as-you-go price for the corresponding commitment term. For PriceType _ReservedInstance_, marketPrice reflects the total price of the one or three-year commitment. |
| 13  | meterId | Unique identifier for the meter. |
| 14  | meterCategory | Name of the classification category for the meter. For example, _Cloud services_, and _Networking_ |
| 15  | meterName | The name of the meter. Purchases and Marketplace usage might be shown as blank or unassigned. |
| 16  | meterSubCategory | Name of the meter subclassification category. Purchases and Marketplace usage might be shown as blank or unassigned. |
| 17  | meterType | Name of the meter type. |
| 18  | meterRegion | The name of the Azure region associated with the meter. It generally aligns with the resource location, except for certain global meters that are shared across regions. In such cases, the meter region indicates the primary region of the meter. The meter is used to track the usage of specific services or resources, mainly for billing purposes. Each Azure service, resource, and region have its own billing meter ID that precisely reflects how its consumption and price are calculated. |
| 19  | priceType | Price type for a product. For example, an Azure resource has its pay-as-you-go rate with priceType as _Consumption_. If the resource is eligible for a savings plan, it also has its savings plan rate with another priceType as _SavingsPlan_. Other priceTypes include _ReservedInstance_. |
| 20  | Product | Name of the product accruing the charges. For example, Basic SQL DB vs Standard SQL DB. |
| 21  | productId | Unique identifier for the product. |
| 22  | serviceFamily |Service family that the service belongs to. |

| 24  | Term | Duration associated with priceType. For example, SavingsPlan priceType has two commitment options: one year and three years. The Term is _P1Y_ for a one-year commitment and _P3Y_ for a three-year commitment. |
| 25  | tierMinimumUnits | Defines the lower bound of the tier range for which prices are defined. For example, if the range is 0 to 100, tierMinimumUnits would be 0. |
| 26  | unitOfMeasure |The unit of measure for billing for the service. For example, compute services are billed per hour.|
| 27  | unitPrice | The per-unit price at the time of billing for a given product or service. It includes any negotiated discounts on top of the market price. For PriceType _ReservedInstance_, unitPrice reflects the total cost of the one or three-year commitment including discounts. **Note**: The unit price isn't the same as the effective price in usage details downloads when services have differential prices across tiers. If services have multi-tiered pricing, the effective price is a blended rate across the tiers and doesn't show a tier-specific unit price. The blended price or effective price is the net price for the consumed quantity spanning across the multiple tiers, where each tier has a specific unit price. |
