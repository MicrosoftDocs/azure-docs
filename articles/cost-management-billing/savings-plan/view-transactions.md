## View payments made

You can view payments that were made using APIs, usage data, and cost analysis. For savings plans paid for monthly, the frequency value is shown as  **recurring** in the usage data and the Savings Plan Charges API. For savings plans paid up front, the value is shown as **onetime**.

Cost analysis shows monthly purchases in the default view. Apply the **purchase** filter to **Charge type** and **recurring** for **Frequency** to see all purchases. To view only savings plans, apply a filter for **Savings Plan**.
