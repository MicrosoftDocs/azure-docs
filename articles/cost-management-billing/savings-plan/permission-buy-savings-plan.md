# Permissions to buy an Azure savings plan

Savings plan discounts only apply to resources associated with subscriptions purchased through an Enterprise Agreement, Microsoft Customer Agreement, or Microsoft Partner Agreement. You can buy a savings plan for an Azure subscription that's of type Enterprise Agreement (MS-AZR-0017P or MS-AZR-0148P), Microsoft Customer Agreement, or Microsoft Partner Agreement. To determine if you're eligible to buy a plan, [check your billing type](../manage/view-all-accounts.md#check-the-type-of-your-account).

>[!NOTE]
> The Azure savings plan isn't supported for the China legacy Online Service Premium Agreement (OSPA) platform.

### Enterprise Agreement customers
Saving plan purchasing for Enterprise Agreement customers is limited to:

- Enterprise Agreement admins with write permissions can purchase savings plans from **Cost Management + Billing** > **Savings plan**. No subscription-specific permissions are needed.
- Users with subscription owner or savings plan purchaser roles in at least one subscription in the enrollment account can purchase savings plans from **Home** > **Savings plan**.

Enterprise Agreement customers can limit savings plan purchases to only Enterprise Agreement admins by disabling the **Add Savings Plan** option in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). To change settings, go to the **Policies** menu.

### Microsoft Customer Agreement customers
Savings plan purchasing for Microsoft Customer Agreement customers is limited to:

- Users with billing profile contributor permissions or higher can purchase savings plans from **Cost Management + Billing** > **Savings plan** experience. No subscription-specific permissions are needed.
- Users with subscription owner or savings plan purchaser roles in at least one subscription in the billing profile can purchase savings plans from **Home** > **Savings plan**.

If the **Add Savings Plan** option is disabled in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), then no user can purchase the Savings Plan. Go to the **Policies** menu to change settings to purchase the Savings Plan.

### Microsoft Partner Agreement partners

Partners can use **Home** > **Savings plan** in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to purchase savings plans on behalf of their customers.

As of June 2023, partners can purchase an Azure savings plan through the Partner Center. Previously, the Azure savings plan was only supported for purchase through the Azure portal. Partners can now purchase an Azure savings plan through the Partner Center portal or APIs. They can also continue to use the Azure portal.

To purchase an Azure savings plan by using the Partner Center APIs, see [Purchase Azure savings plans](/partner-center/developer/azure-purchase-savings-plan).
