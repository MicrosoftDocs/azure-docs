# Migrate from EA Balance Summary API

EA customers who were previously using the Enterprise Reporting consumption.azure.com API to get their balance summary need to migrate to a replacement Azure Resource Manager API. The following instructions help  you migrate and discuss any contract differences between the old API and the new API.

> [!NOTE]
> All Azure Enterprise Reporting APIs are retired. You should [Migrate to Microsoft Cost Management APIs](migrate-ea-reporting-arm-apis-overview.md) as soon as possible.

## Assign permissions to a service principal to call the API

Before calling the API, you need to configure a Service Principal with the correct permission. You use the service principal to call the API. For more information, see [Assign permissions to Cost Management APIs](cost-management-api-permissions.md).

### Call the Balance Summary API

Use the following request URIs when calling the new Balance Summary API. Your enrollment number should be used as the `billingAccountId`.

#### Supported requests

[Get for Enrollment](/rest/api/consumption/balances/getbybillingaccount)


```http
https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/balances?api-version=2023-05-01
```
