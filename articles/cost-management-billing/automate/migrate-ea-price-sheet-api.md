# Migrate from EA Price Sheet API

EA customers who were previously using the Enterprise Reporting consumption.azure.com API to get their price sheet need to migrate to a replacement Azure Resource Manager API. The following instructions help you  migrate and they also describe any contract differences between the old API and the new API.

> [!NOTE]
> All Azure Enterprise Reporting APIs are retired. You should [Migrate to Microsoft Cost Management APIs](migrate-ea-reporting-arm-apis-overview.md) as soon as possible.

## Assign permissions to a service principal to call the API

Before calling the API, you need to configure a service principal (SPN) with the correct permission. You use the service principal to call the API. For more information, see [Assign permissions to Cost Management APIs](cost-management-api-permissions.md).

### Call the Price Sheet API

The Price Sheet API generates the price sheet asynchronously and produces a file that you download.

Use the following request URIs when calling the new Price Sheet API:

#### Supported requests

You can call the API using the following scope:

Enrollment: `providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}`

[Download by billing account for the specified billing period](/rest/api/cost-management/price-sheet/download-by-billing-account)

```HTTP
POST https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}/billingPeriods/{billingPeriodName}/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/pricesheets/default/download?api-version=2023-11-01
```

The POST request returns a location to poll the report generation status as outlined in the following response:
