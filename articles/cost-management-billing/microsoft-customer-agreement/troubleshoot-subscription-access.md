# Troubleshoot subscription access after you sign a Microsoft Customer Agreement

This article helps you troubleshoot subscription access after you sign a new Microsoft Customer Agreement. Use the following information to troubleshoot and resolve common problems.

## Troubleshoot subscription access

Make sure that your billing account type is Microsoft Customer Agreement. You can see your billing account type in the Azure portal in **Cost Management + Billing**. For more information, see [Check if you have access to your MCA](../understand/mca-understand-your-usage.md#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

## Troubleshoot viewing your billing account

If you have trouble viewing your billing account and you have multiple tenants, try switching directories in the Azure portal.

## Troubleshoot account access

You could have multiple accounts with Microsoft that use the same email address. You might have a personal account and a work account. The Microsoft Customer Agreement uses your work or school account. For more information, see [Ensure you sign in with your Work or school Account](https://support.microsoft.com/office/which-account-do-you-want-to-use-2b5bbd7a-7df6-4283-beff-8015e28eb7b9).

- Sign in with your Work or school account.
