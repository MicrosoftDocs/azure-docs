      - question: What if I'm an existing customer purchasing Azure directly from Azure.com?
        answer: |
          Microsoft shares a notice directly with you at least 30 days before the transition to the Microsoft Customer Agreement.
      - question: What Azure Services are available through the Microsoft Customer Agreement?
        answer: |
          All Azure services are available through Microsoft Customer Agreement. Once you accept the Microsoft Customer Agreement, you get the benefit of more free enterprise-grade management tools including new invoice and cost management capabilities through the same portal where you manage your Azure services.
      - question: How is Azure priced under the Microsoft Customer Agreement?
        answer: |
          Azure is priced in US dollars (USD) worldwide under the Microsoft Customer Agreement and Microsoft Partner Agreement. 

          Prices are in your local currency for Enterprise Agreements.

          Azure users are always charged in their local currency. A currency conversion occurs at the time of billing, if the pricing currency isn't the same as the billing currency. 

            -	The [Retail Price API](/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices) returns USD as the default. The API returns a currency conversion if the user specifies a currency. Although convenient, the conversion might cause confusion because the API returns *estimated prices based on the current conversion rate*. If you try to use the API to reconcile your invoice, the API results won’t match the invoice.
            -	When you download your price sheet from the Azure portal:
              - For Enterprise Agreements, prices are in your local currency for Azure first party services.
              - For Microsoft Partner Agreements and Microsoft Customer Agreements, prices are shown in USD for Azure first party services. 

          As mentioned previously, if you transact in one of the other supported currencies listed below, your monthly cost is first calculated in USD. For payment, the total is then converted to the local currency.

      - question: What exchange rate will be used and how does it work with my bill?
        answer: |
          We use London closing spot rates that are captured in the two business days prior to the last business day of the previous month end. If the two business days prior to the end of the month fall on a bank holiday in major markets, the rate setting day is generally the day immediately preceding the two business days. This rate applies to all transactions during the upcoming month.

          For example, the exchange rate for January transactions is first captured in the final days of December. The rate is applied to all Azure purchases made in January and all Azure consumption in January. The January exchange rate and local currency billed amount will appear in the January invoice, which is available at the beginning of February.

      - question: Under the Microsoft Customer Agreement, in which currency will my payment be processed?
        answer: |
          The legal address you provide at the time of signing will determine your billing geography and currency based on the table below:

          | **Country/Region**                  | **Billing currency**    |
