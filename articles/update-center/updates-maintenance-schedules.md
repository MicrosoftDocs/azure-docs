# Update options in Azure Update Manager

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - For a seamless scheduled patching experience, we recommend that for all Azure virtual machines (VMs), you update the patch orchestration to **Customer Managed Schedules**. If you fail to update the patch orchestration, you can experience a disruption in business continuity because the schedules fail to patch the VMs. For more information, see [Configure schedule patching on Azure VMs to ensure business continuity](prerequsite-for-schedule-patching.md).
> - For Azure Arc-enabled servers, the updates and maintenance options such as automatic VM guest patching in Azure, Windows automatic updates, and hot patching aren't supported.

This article provides an overview of the various update and maintenance options available by Azure Update Manager.

Update Manager provides you with the flexibility to take an immediate action or schedule an update within a defined maintenance window. It also supports new patching methods, such as [automatic VM guest patching](../virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching.md) and [hot patching](../automanage/automanage-hotpatch.md?context=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fcontext%2fcontext).

## Update now/One-time update

Update Manager allows you to secure your machines immediately by installing updates on demand. To perform the on-demand updates, see [Check and install one-time updates](deploy-updates.md#install-updates-on-a-single-vm).

## Scheduled patching

You can create a schedule on a daily, weekly, or hourly cadence according to your requirement. You can specify the machines that must be updated as part of the schedule and the updates that must be installed. The schedule then automatically installs the updates according to the specifications.

Update Manager uses a maintenance control schedule instead of creating its own schedules. Maintenance control enables customers to manage platform updates. For more information, see the [Maintenance control documentation](/azure/virtual-machines/maintenance-control).

Start by using [scheduled patching](scheduled-patching.md) to create and save recurring deployment schedules.

> [!NOTE]
> The patch orchestration property for Azure machines should be set to **Customer Managed Schedules** because it's a prerequisite for scheduled patching. For more information, see the [list of prerequisites](../update-center/scheduled-patching.md#prerequisites-for-scheduled-patching).

## Automatic VM guest patching in Azure

This mode of patching lets the Azure platform automatically download and install all the security and critical updates on your machines every month and apply them on your machines following the availability-first principles. For more information, see [Automatic VM guest patching](../virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching.md).

On the **Azure Update Manager** home page, go to **Update Settings** and select **Patch orchestration** as the **Azure Managed - Safe Deployment** value to enable this VM property.

## Windows automatic updates

This mode of patching allows the operating system to automatically install updates as soon as they're available. It uses the VM property that's enabled by setting the patch orchestration to OS orchestrated/automatic by the OS.

## Hot patching

Hot patching allows you to install updates on supported Windows Server Azure Edition VMs without requiring a reboot after installation. It reduces the number of reboots required on your mission-critical application workloads running on Windows Server. For more information, see [Hot patch for new virtual machines](../automanage/automanage-hotpatch.md).

The hot patching property is available as a setting in Update Manager. You can enable it by using the Update settings flow. For detailed instructions, see [Manage update configuration settings](manage-update-settings.md#configure-settings-on-a-single-vm).
