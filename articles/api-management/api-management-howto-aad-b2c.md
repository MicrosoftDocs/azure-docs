# How to authorize developer accounts by using Azure Active Directory B2C in Azure API Management

[!INCLUDE [premium-dev-standard-premiumv2-standardv2-basicv2.md](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-premiumv2-standardv2-basicv2.md)]

Azure Active Directory B2C is a cloud identity management solution for consumer-facing web and mobile applications. You can use it to manage access to your API Management developer portal. 

In this tutorial, you'll learn the configuration required in your API Management service to integrate with Azure Active Directory B2C. 

For an overview of options to secure the developer portal, see [Secure access to the API Management developer portal](secure-developer-portal-access.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * This article has been updated with steps to configure an Azure AD B2C app using the Microsoft Authentication Library ([MSAL](../active-directory/develop/msal-overview.md)). 
> * If you previously configured an Azure AD B2C app for user sign-in using the Azure AD Authentication Library (ADAL), we recommend that you [migrate to MSAL](#migrate-to-msal).


## Prerequisites

* An Azure Active Directory B2C tenant in which to create an application. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory B2C overview](../active-directory-b2c/overview.md).
* An API Management instance. If you don't already have one, [create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
* If you created your instance in a v2 tier, enable the developer portal. For more information, see [Tutorial: Access and customize the developer portal](api-management-howto-developer-portal-customize.md).


## Configure sign up and sign in user flow

In this section, you'll configure a user flow in your Azure Active Directory B2C tenant that enables users to sign up or sign in to the developer portal. Users are led down the right path depending on the context. For detailed steps, see [Create user flows and custom policies in Azure Active Directory B2C](../active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows.md?pivots=b2c-us).

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), access your Azure Active Directory B2C tenant.
1. Under **Policies**, select **User flows** > **+ New user flow**.
1. On the **Create a user flow** page, select the **Sign up and sign in** user flow. Select the **Recommended** version and then select **Create**.
1. On the **Create** page, provide the following information:
    1. Enter a unique name for the user flow.
    1. In **Identity providers**, select **Email signup**.
    1. Optionally enable a **Multifactor authentication** method or **Conditional access** policies.
    1. In **User attributes and token claims**, select the following attributes and claims that you want to collect and send from the user during sign-up. Select **Show more** to view all attributes and claims.
        * **Collect attributes**: Given Name, Surname
        * **Return claims**: Given Name, Surname, Email Addresses, Userâ€™s ObjectID

             ![Screenshot of attributes and claims in the portal](./media/api-management-howto-aad-b2c/api-management-application-claims.png)
1. Select **Create**.

## Configure identity provider for developer portal

1. In a separate [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) tab, navigate to your API Management instance.
1. Under **Developer portal**, select **Identities** > **+ Add**.
1. In the **Add identity provider** page, select **Azure Active Directory B2C**. Once selected, you'll be able to enter other necessary information. 
    * In the **Client library** dropdown, select **MSAL**.
    * To add other settings, see steps later in the article.
1. In the **Add identity provider** window, copy the **Redirect URL**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-aad-b2c/b2c-identity-provider-redirect-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the redirect URL in the portal.":::    

1. Return to the browser tab for your Azure Active Directory B2C tenant in the Azure portal. Select **App registrations** >  **+ New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application** page, enter your application's registration information.
    * In the **Name** section, enter an application name of your choosing.
    * In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (for authenticating users with user flows)**. For more information, see [Register an application](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.md#register-an-application).
    * In **Redirect URI**, select **Single-page application (SPA)** and paste the redirect URL you saved from a previous step.
    * In **Permissions**, select **Grant admin consent to openid and offline_access permissions.**
    * Select **Register** to create the application.

    :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-aad-b2c/b2c-app-registration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of registering a new application in the portal.":::

1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** and copy the value to the clipboard.

    :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-aad-b2c/b2c-app-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Overview page in the portal.":::
1. Switch back to the API Management **Add identity provider** page and paste the ID into the **Client Id** text box.
1. Switch back to the B2C app registration. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **+ New client secret**. 
    :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-aad-b2c/generate-app-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a client secret in the portal."::: 
   * In the **Add a client secret** page, enter a **Description** and select **Add**.
   * Record the **Value** in a safe location. This secret value is never displayed again after you leave this page.
1. Switch back to the API Management **Add identity provider** page, and paste the key into the **Client secret** text box.
1. Continuing on the **Add identity provider** page:
    * In **Signin tenant**, specify the domain name of the Azure Active Directory B2C tenant.
    * The **Authority** field lets you control the Azure Active Directory B2C login URL to use. Set the value to **<your_b2c_tenant_name>.b2clogin.com**.
    * Specify the **Sign-up Policy** and **Sign-in Policy** using the name of the user flow you created in a previous step.
    * Optionally provide the **Profile Editing Policy** and **Password Reset Policy**.

         :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-aad-b2c/add-identity-provider.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Active Directory B2C identity provider configuration in the portal.":::
1. After you've specified the desired configuration, select **Add**.
1. Republish the developer portal for the Azure AD B2C configuration to take effect. In the left menu, under **Developer portal**, select **Portal overview** > **Publish**.

After the changes are saved, developers will be able to sign up for new accounts and sign in to the developer portal by using Azure Active Directory B2C.

## Migrate to MSAL

If you previously configured an Azure AD B2C app for user sign-in using the ADAL, you can use the portal to migrate the app to MSAL and update the identity provider in API Management.

### Update Azure AD B2C app for MSAL compatibility

For steps to update the Azure AD B2C app, see [Switch redirect URIs to the single-page application type](../active-directory/develop/migrate-spa-implicit-to-auth-code.md#switch-redirect-uris-to-spa-platform).

### Update identity provider configuration

1. In the left menu of your API Management instance, under **Developer portal**, select **Identities**.
1. Select **Azure Active Directory B2C** from the list.
1. In the **Client library** dropdown, select **MSAL**.
1. Select **Update**.
1. [Republish your developer portal](developer-portal-overview.md#publish-the-portal).


## Developer portal - add Azure Active Directory B2C account authentication

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to [republish the developer portal](developer-portal-overview.md#publish-the-portal) when you create or update Azure Active Directory B2C configuration settings for the changes to take effect.

In the developer portal, sign-in with Azure Active Directory B2C is possible with the **Sign-in button: OAuth** widget. The widget is already included on the sign-in page of the default developer portal content.

1. To sign in by using Azure Active Directory B2C, open a new browser window and go to the developer portal. Select **Sign in**.

1. On the **Sign in** page, select **Azure Active Directory B2C**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-aad-b2c/developer-portal-sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot of signing in to developer portal.":::
1. You're redirected to the signup policy that you configured in the previous section. Choose to sign up by using your email address in the Active Directory B2C tenant.

When the signup is complete, you're redirected back to the developer portal. You're now signed in to the developer portal for your API Management service instance.

:::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-aad-b2c/developer-portal-home.png" alt-text="Sign in to developer portal complete":::

Although a new account is automatically created whenever a new user signs in with Azure Active Directory B2C, you may consider adding the same widget to the signup page.

The **Sign-up form: OAuth** widget represents a form used for signing up with OAuth.
