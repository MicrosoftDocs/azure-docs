# HTTP data source for a resolver

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

The `http-data-source` resolver policy configures the HTTP request and optionally the HTTP response to resolve data for an object type and field in a GraphQL schema. The schema must be imported to API Management as a GraphQL API.  

[!INCLUDE [api-management-policy-generic-alert](../../includes/api-management-policy-generic-alert.md)]

## Usage

- [**Policy scopes:**](./api-management-howto-policies.md#scopes) GraphQL resolver
-  [**Gateways:**](api-management-gateways-overview.md) classic, v2, consumption

### Usage notes

* To configure and manage a resolver with this policy, see [Configure a GraphQL resolver](configure-graphql-resolver.md).
* This policy is invoked only when resolving a single field in a matching GraphQL operation type in the schema. 

## Examples

### Resolver for GraphQL query

The following example resolves a query by making an HTTP `GET` call to a backend data source.

#### Example schema

```
type Query {
    users: [User]
}

type User {
    id: String!
    name: String!
}
```

#### Example policy

```xml
<http-data-source>
    <http-request>
        <set-method>GET</set-method>
        <set-url>https://data.contoso.com/get/users</set-url>
    </http-request>
</http-data-source>
```

### Resolver for a GraphQL query that returns a list, using a liquid template

The following example uses a liquid template, supported for use in the [set-body](set-body-policy.md) policy, to return a list in the HTTP response to a query.  It also renames the `username` field in the response from the REST API to `name` in the GraphQL response.

#### Example schema

```
type Query {
    users: [User]
}

type User {
    id: String!
    name: String!
}
```

#### Example policy

```xml
<http-data-source>
    <http-request>
        <set-method>GET</set-method>
        <set-url>https://data.contoso.com/users</set-url>
    </http-request>
    <http-response>
        <set-body template="liquid">
            [
                {% JSONArrayFor elem in body %}
                    {
                        "name": "{{elem.username}}"
                    }
                {% endJSONArrayFor %}
            ]
        </set-body>
    </http-response>
</http-data-source>
```

### Resolver for GraphQL mutation

The following example resolves a mutation that inserts data by making a `POST` request to an HTTP data source. The policy expression in the `set-body` policy of the HTTP request modifies a `name` argument that is passed in the GraphQL query as its body. The body that is sent will look like the following JSON:

``` json
{
    "name": "the-provided-name"
}
```

#### Example schema

```
type Query {
    users: [User]
}

type Mutation {
    makeUser(name: String!): User
}

type User {
    id: String!
    name: String!
}
```

#### Example policy

```xml
<http-data-source>
    <http-request>
        <set-method>POST</set-method>
        <set-url>https://data.contoso.com/user/create </set-url>
        <set-header name="Content-Type" exists-action="override">
            <value>application/json</value>
        </set-header>
        <set-body>@{
            var args = context.GraphQL.Arguments;  
            JObject jsonObject = new JObject();
            jsonObject.Add("name", args["name"])
            return jsonObject.ToString();
        }</set-body>
    </http-request>
</http-data-source>
```

### Resolver for GraphQL union type

The following example resolves the `orderById` query by making an HTTP `GET` call to a backend data source and returns a JSON object that includes the customer ID and type. The customer type is a union of `RegisteredCustomer` and `GuestCustomer` types.

#### Example schema

```graphql
type Query {
  orderById(orderId: Int): Order
}

type Order {
  customerId: Int!
  orderId: Int!  
  customer: Customer
}

enum AccountType {
  Registered
  Guest
}

union Customer = RegisteredCustomer | GuestCustomer

type RegisteredCustomer {
  accountType: AccountType!
  customerId: Int!
  customerGuid: String!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  isActive: Boolean!
}

type GuestCustomer {
  accountType: AccountType!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
}
```

#### Example policy

For this example, we mock the customer results from an external source, and hard code the fetched results in the `set-body` policy. The `__typename` field is used to determine the type of the customer.

```xml
<http-data-source>
    <http-request>
        <set-method>GET</set-method>
        <set-url>https://data.contoso.com/orders/</set-url>
    </http-request>
    <http-response>
        <set-body>{"customerId": 12345, "accountType": "Registered", "__typename": "RegisteredCustomer" }
        </set-body>
    </http-response>
</http-data-source>
```
