# Test the self-hosted developer portal

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic-premiumv2-standardv2-basicv2](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic-premiumv2-standardv2-basicv2.md)]

This article explains how to set up unit tests and end-to-end tests for your [self-hosted portal](developer-portal-self-host.md).

## Unit tests

A unit test is an approach to validate small pieces of functionality. It's done in isolation from other parts of the application.

### Example scenario

In this scenario, you're testing a password input control. It only accepts passwords containing at least:

- One letter

- One number

- One special character
 
So, the test to validate these requirements looks like this:

```typescript
const passwordInput = new PasswordInput();

passwordInput.value = "";
expect(passwordInput.isValid).to.equal(false);

passwordInput.value = "password";
expect(passwordInput.isValid).to.equal(false);

passwordInput.value = "p@ssw0rd";
expect(passwordInput.isValid.to.equal(true);
```
 
### Project structure

It's common to keep a unit test next to the component it's supposed to validate.

```console
component.ts
component.spec.ts
```

### Mock HTTP requests

There are cases when you expect a component to make HTTP requests. The component should react properly to different kind of responses. To simulate specific HTTP responses, use `MockHttpClient`. It implements the `HttpClient` interface used by many other components of the project.

```typescript
const httpClient = new MockHttpClient();

httpClient.mock()
    .get("/users/jane")
    .reply(200, {
        firstName: "Jane",
        lastName: "Doe"
    });
```

## End-to-end tests

An end-to-end test executes a particular user scenario taking exact steps that you expect the user to carry out. In a web application like te Azure API Management developer portal, the user scrolls through the content and selects options to achieve certain results. 

To replicate user navigation, you can use browser manipulation helper libraries like [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer). It lets you simulate user actions and automate assumed scenarios. Puppeteer also automatically takes screenshots of pages or components at any stage of the test. Compare them later with previous results to catch deviations and potential regressions.

### Example scenario

In this scenario, you need to validate a user sign-in flow. This scenario would require the following steps:

1. Open browser and navigate to the sign-in page.

1. Enter the email address.

1. Enter the password.

1. Select **Sign-in**.

1. Verify that user got redirected to Home page.

1. Verify that the page includes the **Profile** menu item. It's one of the possible indicators that you successfully signed in.

To run the test automatically, create a script with exactly the same steps:

```typescript
// 1. Open browser and navigate to the sign-in page.
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto("https://contoso.com/signin");

// 2. Enter email.
await this.page.type("#email", "john.doe@contoso.com");

// 3. Enter password.
await this.page.type("#password", "p@s$w0rd");

// 4. Click Sign-in.
await this.page.click("#signin");

// 5. Verify that user got redirected to Home page.
expect(page.url()).to.equal("https://contoso.com");

// 6. Verify that the page includes the Profile menu item.
const profileMenuItem = await this.page.$("#profile");
expect(profileMenuItem).not.equals(null);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Strings such as "#email", "#password" and "#signin" are CSS-like selectors that identify HTML elements on the page. See the [Selectors Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/) W3C specification to learn more.

### UI component maps

User flows often go through the same pages or components. A good example is the main website menu that is present on every page. 

Create a UI component map to avoid configuring and updating the same selectors for every test. For example, you could replace steps 2 through 6 in the preceding example with just two lines:

```typescript
const signInWidget = new SigninBasicWidget(page);
await signInWidget.signInWithBasic({ email: "...", password: "..." });
```

### Test configuration

Certain scenarios may require pre-created data or configuration. For example, you may need to automate user sign-in with social media accounts. It's hard to create that data quickly or easily.

For this purpose, you could add a special configuration file to your test scenario. The test scripts can pick up required data from the file. Depending on the build and test pipeline, the tests can pull the secrets from a named secure store.

Here's an example of a `validate.config.json` that would be stored in the `src` folder of your project.

```json
{
    "environment": "validation",
    "urls": {
        "home": "https://contoso.com",
        "signin": "https://contoso.com/signin",
        "signup": "https://contoso.com/signup/"
    },
    "signin": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "credentials": {
            "basic": {
                "email": "johndoe@contoso.com",
                "password": "< password >"
            },
            "aadB2C": {
                "email": "johndoe@contoso.com",
                "password": "< password >"
            }
        }
    },
    "signup": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "credentials": {
            "basic": {
                "email": "johndoe@contoso.com",
                "password": "< password >"
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### Headless vs normal tests

Modern browsers such as Chrome or Microsoft Edge allows you to run automation in both headless mode and normal mode. The browser operates without a graphical user interface in headless mode. It still carries out the same page and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulations. The browser UI usually isn't needed in delivery pipelines. In that case, running tests in headless mode is a great option.

When you develop a test script, it's useful to see what exactly is happening in the browser. That's a good time to use normal mode.

To switch between the modes, change the option `headless` option in the `constants.ts` file. It's in the `tests` folder in your project:

```typescript
export const LaunchOptions = {
    headless: false
};
```

Another useful option is `slowMo`. It pauses the execution of the test between each action:

```typescript
export const LaunchOptions = {
    slowMo: 200 // milliseconds
};
```

## Run tests

There are two built-in ways to execute tests in this project:

**npm command**

```console
npm run test
```

**Test Explorer**

The Test Explorer extension for VS Code (for example, [Mocha Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-mocha-test-adapter)) has a convenient UI and an option to run tests automatically on every change of the source code:
