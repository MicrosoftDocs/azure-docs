# Reference: Self-hosted gateway Azure Arc configuration settings

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-dev](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev.md)]

This article provides a reference for required and optional settings that are used to configure the Azure Arc extension for API Management [self-hosted gateway container](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md). 

[!INCLUDE [preview](./includes/preview/preview-callout-self-hosted-gateway-azure-arc.md)]

## Configuration API integration

The Configuration API is used by the self-hosted gateway to connect to Azure API Management to get the latest configuration and send metrics, when enabled.
