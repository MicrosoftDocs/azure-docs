# Wait

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

The `wait` policy executes its immediate child policies in parallel, and waits for either all or one of its immediate child policies to complete before it completes. The `wait` policy can have as its immediate child policies one or more of the following: [`send-request`](send-request-policy.md), [`cache-lookup-value`](cache-lookup-value-policy.md), and [`choose`](choose-policy.md) policies.

[!INCLUDE [api-management-policy-generic-alert](../../includes/api-management-policy-generic-alert.md)]


## Policy statement

```xml
<wait for="all | any">
  <!--Wait policy can contain send-request, cache-lookup-value,
        and choose policies as child elements -->
</wait>

```

## Attributes

| Attribute         | Description                                            | Required | Default |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------- |
| for       | Determines whether the `wait` policy waits for all immediate child policies to be completed or just one. Allowed values are:<br /><br /> - `all` - wait for all immediate child policies to complete<br />- `any` - wait for any immediate child policy to complete. Once the first immediate child policy has completed, the `wait` policy completes and execution of any other immediate child policies is terminated.<br/><br/>Policy expressions are allowed. | No       | `all`     |


## Elements

May contain as child elements only `send-request`, `cache-lookup-value`, and `choose` policies.

## Usage

- [**Policy sections:**](./api-management-howto-policies.md#sections) inbound, outbound, backend
- [**Policy scopes:**](./api-management-howto-policies.md#scopes) global, workspace, product, API, operation
-  [**Gateways:**](api-management-gateways-overview.md) classic, v2, consumption, self-hosted, workspace

## Example

In the following example, there are two `choose` policies as immediate child policies of the `wait` policy. Each of these `choose` policies executes in parallel. Each `choose` policy attempts to retrieve a cached value. If there is a cache miss, a backend service is called to provide the value. In this example the `wait` policy does not complete until all of its immediate child policies complete, because the `for` attribute is set to `all`. In this example the context variables (`execute-branch-one`, `value-one`, `execute-branch-two`, and `value-two`) are declared outside of the scope of this example policy.

```xml
<wait for="all">
  <choose>
    <when condition="@((bool)context.Variables["execute-branch-one="])">
      <cache-lookup-value key="key-one" variable-name="value-one" />
      <choose>
        <when condition="@(!context.Variables.ContainsKey("value-one="))">
          <send-request mode="new" response-variable-name="value-one">
            <set-url>https://backend-one</set-url>
            <set-method>GET</set-method>
          </send-request>
        </when>
      </choose>
    </when>
  </choose>
  <choose>
    <when condition="@((bool)context.Variables["execute-branch-two="])">
      <cache-lookup-value key="key-two" variable-name="value-two" />
      <choose>
        <when condition="@(!context.Variables.ContainsKey("value-two="))">
          <send-request mode="new" response-variable-name="value-two">
            <set-url>https://backend-two</set-url>
            <set-method>GET</set-method>
          </send-request>
        </when>
      </choose>
    </when>
  </choose>
</wait>
```
