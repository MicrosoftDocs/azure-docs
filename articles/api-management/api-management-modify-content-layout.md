# Modify the content and layout of pages on the developer portal in Azure API Management
There are three fundamental ways to customize the developer portal in Azure API Management:

* [Edit the contents of static pages and page layout elements][modify-content-layout] (explained in this guide)
* [Update the styles used for page elements across the developer portal][customize-styles]
* [Modify the templates used for pages generated by the portal][portal-templates] (e.g. API docs, products, user authentication, etc.)

## <a name="page-structure"> </a>Structure of developer portal pages

The developer portal is based on a content management system. The layout of every page is built based on set of small page elements known as widgets:

![Developer portal page structure][api-management-customization-widget-structure]

All widgets are editable. 
* The core contents specific to each individual page reside in the "Contents" widget. Editing a page means editing the contents of this widget.
* All page layout elements are contained with the remaining widgets. Changes made to these widgets will apply to all pages. They will be referred to as "layout widgets".

In day-to-day page editing one usually only modifies the Content widget which will have different content for each individual page.

Content within the developer portal is modified via the publisher portal which is accessible from the Azure Portal. To reach it, click **Publisher portal** from the service toolbar of your API Management instance.

![Publisher portal][api-management-management-console]

To edit the contents of that widget, click **Widgets** from the **Developer Portal** menu on the left. For this example lets modify the contents of the Header widget. Select the **Header** widget from the list.

![Widgets header][api-management-widgets-header]

The contents of the header is editable from within the **Body** field. Change the text as desired and then click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

Now you should be able to see the new header on every page within the developer portal.

> To open the developer portal while in the publisher portal, click **Developer portal** in the top bar.

## <a name="edit-page-contents"> </a>Edit the contents of a page

To see the list of all existing content pages, click **Content** from the **Developer portal** menu in the publisher portal.

![Manage content][api-management-customization-manage-content]

Click the **Welcome** page to edit what is displayed on the home page of the developer portal. Make the changes you want, preview them if necessary, and then click **Publish Now** to make them visible to everyone.

> The home page uses a special layout that allows it to display a banner at the top. This banner is not editable from the **Content** section. To edit this banner, click **Widgets** from the **Developer portal** menu, select **Home page** from the **Current Layer** drop-down list, and then open the **Banner** item under the **Featured section**. The contents of this widget are editable just like any other page.
