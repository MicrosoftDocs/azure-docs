# Network resource requirements for integration of a workspace gateway into a virtual network

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium.md)]

Network isolation is an optional feature of an API Management [workspace gateway](workspaces-overview.md#workspace-gateway). This article provides network resource requirements when you integrate your gateway in an Azure virtual network. Some requirements differ depending on the desired inbound and outbound access mode. The following modes are supported:

* Public inbound access, private outbound access (Public/Private)
* Private inbound access, private outbound access (Private/Private)

For information about networking options in API Management, see [Use a virtual network to secure inbound or outbound traffic for Azure API Management](virtual-network-concepts.md).

[!INCLUDE [api-management-virtual-network-workspaces-alert](../../includes/api-management-virtual-network-workspaces-alert.md)]


## Network location

* The virtual network must be in the same region and Azure subscription as the API Management instance.

### Dedicated subnet

* The subnet used for virtual network integration can only be used by a single workspace gateway. It can't be shared with another Azure resource.

## Subnet size 

* Minimum: /27 (32 addresses)
* Maximum: /24 (256 addresses) - recommended

## Subnet delegation

The subnet must be delegated as follows to enable the desired inbound and outbound access. 

For information about configuring subnet delegation, see [Add or remove a subnet delegation](../virtual-network/manage-subnet-delegation.md).

#### [Public/Private](#tab/external)


For Public/Private mode, the subnet needs to be delegated to the **Microsoft.Web/serverFarms** service.

> [!NOTE]
> You might need to register the `Microsoft.Web/serverFarms` resource provider in the subscription so that you can delegate the subnet to the service.

#### [Private/Private](#tab/internal)

For Private/Private mode, the subnet needs to be delegated to the **Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments** service.

## Network security group (NSG) rules

A network security group (NSG) must be attached to the subnet to explicitly allow inbound connectivity. Configure the following rules in the NSG. Set the priority of these rules higher than that of the default rules.

#### [Public/Private](#tab/external)

| Source / Destination Port(s) | Direction          | Transport protocol |   Source | Destination   | Purpose |
|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| */80                          | Inbound            | TCP                | AzureLoadBalancer | Workspace gateway subnet range                           | Allow internal health ping traffic     |
| */80,443 | Inbound | TCP | Internet | Workspace gateway subnet range | Allow inbound traffic |

#### [Private/Private](#tab/internal)

| Source / Destination Port(s) | Direction          | Transport protocol |   Source | Destination   | Purpose |
|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| */80                          | Inbound            | TCP                | AzureLoadBalancer | Workspace gateway subnet range                           | Allow internal health ping traffic     |
| */80,443 | Inbound | TCP | Virtual network | Workspace gateway subnet range | Allow inbound traffic |

## DNS settings for Private/Private configuration

In the Private/Private network configuration, you have to manage your own DNS to enable inbound access to your workspace gateway. 

We recommend:

1. Configure an Azure [DNS private zone](../dns/private-dns-overview.md).
1. Link the Azure DNS private zone to the VNet into which you've deployed your workspace gateway. 

Learn how to [set up a private zone in Azure DNS](../dns/private-dns-getstarted-portal.md).


### Access on default hostname

When you create an API Management workspace, the workspace gateway is assigned a default hostname. The hostname is visible in the Azure portal on the workspace gateway's **Overview** page, along with its private virtual IP address. The default hostname is in the format `<gateway-name>-<random hash>.gateway.<region>-<number>.azure-api.net`. Example: `team-workspace-123456abcdef.gateway.uksouth-01.azure-api.net`.

> [!NOTE]
> The workspace gateway only responds to requests to the hostname configured on its endpoint, not its private VIP address. 

### Configure DNS record

Create an A record in your DNS server to access the workspace from within your VNet. Map the endpoint record to the private VIP address of your workspace gateway.

For testing purposes, you might update the hosts file on a virtual machine in a subnet connected to the VNet in which API Management is deployed. Assuming the private virtual IP address for your workspace gateway is 10.1.0.5, you can map the hosts file as shown in the following example. The hosts mapping file is at  `%SystemDrive%\drivers\etc\hosts` (Windows) or `/etc/hosts` (Linux, macOS). 

| Internal virtual IP address | Gateway hostname |
| ----- | ----- |
| 10.1.0.5 | `teamworkspace.gateway.westus.azure-api.net` |
