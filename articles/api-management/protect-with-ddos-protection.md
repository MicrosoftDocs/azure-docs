# Defend your Azure API Management instance against DDoS attacks

[!INCLUDE [premium-dev.md](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev.md)]

This article shows how to defend your Azure API Management instance against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks by enabling [Azure DDoS Protection](../ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview.md). Azure DDoS Protection provides enhanced DDoS mitigation features to defend against volumetric and protocol DDoS attacks.â€‹

[!INCLUDE [ddos-waf-recommendation](../../includes/ddos-waf-recommendation.md)]

## Supported configurations

Enabling Azure DDoS Protection for API Management is supported only for instances **deployed (injected) in a VNet** in [external mode](api-management-using-with-vnet.md) or [internal mode](api-management-using-with-internal-vnet.md).

* External mode - All API Management endpoints are protected
* Internal mode - Only the management endpoint accessible on port 3443 is protected

### Unsupported configurations

* Instances that aren't VNet-injected
* Instances configured with a [private endpoint](private-endpoint.md)


## Prerequisites

* An API Management instance
    * The instance must be deployed in an Azure VNet in [external mode](api-management-using-with-vnet.md) or [internal mode](api-management-using-with-internal-vnet.md).
    * The instance must be configured with an Azure public IP address resource.

* An Azure DDoS Protection [plan](../ddos-protection/manage-ddos-protection.md)
    * The plan you select can be in the same, or different, subscription than the virtual network and the API Management instance. If the subscriptions differ, they must be associated to the same Microsoft Entra tenant.
    * You may use a plan created using either the Network DDoS protection SKU or IP DDoS Protection SKU. See [Azure DDoS Protection SKU Comparison](../ddos-protection/ddos-protection-sku-comparison.md).

        > [!NOTE]
        > Azure DDoS Protection plans incur additional charges. For more information, see [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ddos-protection/).
     
## Enable DDoS Protection

Depending on the DDoS Protection plan you use, enable DDoS protection on the virtual network used for your API Management instance, or the IP address resource configured for your virtual network.

### Enable DDoS Protection on the virtual network used for your API Management instance

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the VNet where your API Management is injected.
1. In the left menu, under **Settings**, select **DDoS protection**.
1. Select **Enable**, and then select your **DDoS protection plan**.
1. Select **Save**.

### Enable DDoS protection on the API Management public IP address

If your plan uses the IP DDoS Protection SKU, see [Enable DDoS IP Protection for a public IP address](../ddos-protection/manage-ddos-protection-powershell-ip.md#disable-ddos-ip-protection-for-an-existing-public-ip-address).
