# Set backend service

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

Use the `set-backend-service` policy to redirect an incoming request to a different backend than the one specified in the API settings for that operation. This policy changes the backend service base URL of the incoming request to a URL or [backend](backends.md) specified in the policy.

Referencing a backend entity allows you to manage the backend service base URL and other settings in a single place and reuse them across multiple APIs and operations. Also implement [load balancing of traffic across a pool of backend services](backends.md#load-balanced-pool) and [circuit breaker rules](backends.md#circuit-breaker) to protect the backend from too many requests.

> [!NOTE]
> Backend entities can be managed via [Azure portal](how-to-configure-service-fabric-backend.yml), management [API](/rest/api/apimanagement), and [PowerShell](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=apimanagement).

## Policy statement

```xml
<set-backend-service base-url="base URL of the backend service"  backend-id="name of the backend entity specifying base URL of the backend service" sf-resolve-condition="condition" sf-service-instance-name="Service Fabric service name" sf-listener-name="Service Fabric listener name" />
```

## Attributes

| Attribute         | Description                                            | Required | Default |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------- |
|base-url|New backend service base URL. Policy expressions are allowed.|One of `base-url` or `backend-id` must be present.|N/A|
|backend-id|Identifier (name) of the [backend](backends.md) to route primary or secondary replica of a partition. Policy expressions are allowed. |One of `base-url` or `backend-id` must be present.|N/A|
|sf-resolve-condition|Only applicable when the backend is a Service Fabric service. Condition identifying if the call to Service Fabric backend has to be repeated with new resolution. Policy expressions are allowed.|No|N/A|
|sf-service-instance-name|Only applicable when the backend is a Service Fabric service. Allows changing service instances at runtime. Policy expressions are allowed. |No|N/A|
|sf-partition-key|Only applicable when the backend is a Service Fabric service. Specifies the partition key of a Service Fabric service. Policy expressions are allowed. |No|N/A|
|sf-listener-name|Only applicable when the backend is a Service Fabric service and is specified using `backend-id`. Service Fabric Reliable Services allows you to create multiple listeners in a service. This attribute is used to select a specific listener when a backend Reliable Service has more than one listener. If this attribute isn't specified, API Management will attempt to use a listener without a name. A listener without a name is typical for Reliable Services that have only one listener. Policy expressions are allowed.|No|N/A|

## Usage

- [**Policy sections:**](./api-management-howto-policies.md#sections) inbound, backend
- [**Policy scopes:**](./api-management-howto-policies.md#scopes) global, workspace, product, API, operation
-  [**Gateways:**](api-management-gateways-overview.md) classic, v2, consumption, self-hosted, workspace

### Usage notes

Currently, if you define a base `set-backend-service` policy using the `backend-id` attribute and inherit the base policy using `<base />` within the scope, then it can only be overridden with a policy using the `backend-id` attribute, not the `base-url` attribute.

## Examples

### Route request based on value in query string

In this example the `set-backend-service` policy routes requests based on the version value passed in the query string to a different backend service than the one specified in the API.


```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <choose>
            <when condition="@(context.Request.Url.Query.GetValueOrDefault("version") == "2013-05")">
                <set-backend-service base-url="http://contoso.com/api/8.2/" />
            </when>
            <when condition="@(context.Request.Url.Query.GetValueOrDefault("version") == "2014-03")">
                <set-backend-service base-url="http://contoso.com/api/9.1/" />
            </when>
        </choose>
        <base />
    </inbound>
    <outbound>
        <base />
    </outbound>
</policies>
```

Initially the backend service base URL is derived from the API settings. So the request URL `https://contoso.azure-api.net/api/partners/15?version=2013-05&subscription-key=abcdef` becomes `http://contoso.com/api/10.4/partners/15?version=2013-05&subscription-key=abcdef` where `http://contoso.com/api/10.4/` is the backend service URL specified in the API settings.

When the [<choose\>](choose-policy.md) policy statement is applied the backend service base URL may change again either to `http://contoso.com/api/8.2` or `http://contoso.com/api/9.1`, depending on the value of the version request query parameter. For example, if the value is `"2013-15"` the final request URL becomes `http://contoso.com/api/8.2/partners/15?version=2013-15&subscription-key=abcdef`.

If further transformation of the request is desired, other [Transformation policies](api-management-policies.md#transformation) can be used. For example, to remove the version query parameter now that the request is being routed to a version specific backend, the [Set query string parameter](set-query-parameter-policy.md) policy can be used to remove the now redundant version attribute.

### Route requests to a service fabric backend

In this example the policy routes the request to a service fabric backend, using the userId query string as the partition key and using the primary replica of the partition.

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <set-backend-service backend-id="my-sf-service" sf-partition-key="@(context.Request.Url.Query.GetValueOrDefault("userId","")" sf-replica-type="primary" />
    </inbound>
    <outbound>
        <base />
    </outbound>
</policies>
```
