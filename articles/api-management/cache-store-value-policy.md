# Store value in cache

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

The `cache-store-value` performs cache storage by key. The key can have an arbitrary string value and is typically provided using a policy expression.

> [!NOTE]
> The operation of storing the value in cache performed by this policy is asynchronous. The stored value can be retrieved using [Get value from cache](cache-lookup-value-policy.md) policy. However, the stored value may not be immediately available for retrieval since the asynchronous operation that stores the value in cache may still be in progress.

## Policy statement

```xml
<cache-store-value key="cache key value" value="value to cache" duration="seconds" caching-type="prefer-external | external | internal" />
```
