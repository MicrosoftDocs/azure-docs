# Log to event hub

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

The `log-to-eventhub` policy sends messages in the specified format to an event hub defined by a [Logger](/rest/api/apimanagement/current-ga/logger) entity. As its name implies, the policy is used for saving selected request or response context information for online or offline analysis.  

> [!NOTE]
> For a step-by-step guide on configuring an event hub and logging events, see [How to log API Management events with Azure Event Hubs](./api-management-howto-log-event-hubs.md).

[!INCLUDE [api-management-policy-generic-alert](../../includes/api-management-policy-generic-alert.md)]

```xml
<log-to-eventhub logger-id="id of the logger entity" partition-id="index of the partition where messages are sent" partition-key="value used for partition assignment">
  Expression returning a string to be logged
</log-to-eventhub>
```

## Usage

- [**Policy sections:**](./api-management-howto-policies.md#sections) inbound, outbound, backend, on-error
- [**Policy scopes:**](./api-management-howto-policies.md#scopes) global, product, API, operation
-  [**Gateways:**](api-management-gateways-overview.md) classic, v2, consumption, self-hosted

### Usage notes

* The policy is not affected by Application Insights sampling. All invocations of the policy will be logged.
* The maximum supported message size that can be sent to an event hub from this policy is 200 kilobytes (KB). A larger message will be automatically truncated to 200 KB before transfer to an event hub.

## Example

Any string can be used as the value to be logged in Event Hubs. In this example the date and time, deployment service name, request ID, IP address, and operation name for all inbound calls are logged to the event hub Logger registered with the `contoso-logger` ID.

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <log-to-eventhub logger-id ='contoso-logger'>
      @( string.Join(",", DateTime.UtcNow, context.Deployment.ServiceName, context.RequestId, context.Request.IpAddress, context.Operation.Name) )
    </log-to-eventhub>
  </inbound>
  <outbound>
  </outbound>
</policies>
```
