# Workspaces breaking changes, part 2 (March 2025)

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium](../../../includes/api-management-availability-premium.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These breaking changes apply only to *preview* workspaces in Azure API Management. If you created workspaces after the generally available release in August 2024 and use workspaces with workspace gateways, your workspaces shouldn't be affected by these changes.
> 

Azure API Management [workspaces](../workspaces-overview.md) are now generally available, and we introduced several feature updates with that release. As part of our continued development of workspaces, we're removing support for preview workspaces (created before August 2024). If you created preview workspaces in Azure API Management and want to continue using them, you need to migrate your workspaces to the generally available version. 

After 31 March 2025, your preview workspaces and APIs managed in them may stop working if you haven't migrated to the latest workspace capabilities. APIs and resources managed outside workspaces aren't affected by this change.

## Is my service affected by these changes?

Your service may be affected by these changes if you created preview workspaces in your API Management instance, before the generally available release of workspaces in August 2024. Workspaces created after the generally available release date that use workspace gateways for API runtime aren't affected by the breaking changes.

## Breaking changes

The following are breaking changes that require you to take action to migrate your preview workspaces to the generally available version:

* **Workspace API gateway is required** -  Each workspace must be associated with a workspace API gateway that isolates the workspace's runtime traffic. In preview, workspaces shared a gateway with the service.
* **Service-level managed identities are not supported** - To improve the security of workspaces, system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities enabled at the service level can't be used in workspaces. Currently, related API Management features that depend on managed identities, such as storing named values and certificates in Azure Key Vault, and using the `authentication-managed-identity` policy, aren't supported in workspaces.

> [!NOTE]
> These breaking changes are in addition to the [June 2024 breaking changes](workspaces-breaking-changes-june-2024.md) for preview workspaces that were announced previously.

## What is the deadline for the change?

The breaking changes will be enforced in preview workspaces after 31 March 2025. We strongly recommend that you make all required changes to the configuration of your preview workspaces before that date.

## What do I need to do?

If your workspaces are affected by these changes, you need to migrate your workspaces to align with the generally available capabilities. The following sections provide guidance on how to migrate your workspaces.

### Use Premium tier for your API Management instance

Ensure that your API Management instance is running in the **Premium** tier to continue using workspaces. As announced [previously](workspaces-breaking-changes-june-2024.md), if your instance is in the **Standard** or **Developer** tier, you need to upgrade to the **Premium** tier.

### Confirm the region for your instance

Adding a workspace gateway to a workspace requires that the gateway is in the same region as your instance. Currently, workspace gateways are supported in a [subset of regions](../workspaces-overview.md#workspace-gateway) in which API Management is available. The regions with support for workspace gateways will be updated over time.

To determine if a preview workspace is in a supported region:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API Management instance.
1. In the left menu, under **APIs**, select **Workspaces**, and select a workspace.
1. If your workspace is in a region that doesn't support workspace gateways, you'll see a message in the portal similar to "Workspaces are currently unavailable in the region of your API Management service". 
    * If you see this message, you can [move your API Management instance](../api-management-howto-migrate.md) to a supported region.
    * If you don't see this message, your workspace is in a supported region and you can proceed to add a workspace gateway.

### Add a workspace gateway to your workspace

The following are abbreviated steps to add a workspace gateway to a workspace. For gateway networking options, prerequisites, and detailed instructions, see [Create and manage a workspace](../how-to-create-workspace.md).

> [!NOTE]
> * The workspace gateway incurs additional charges. For more information, see [API Management pricing](https://aka.ms/apimpricing).
> * We're introducing the ability to associate multiple workspaces with a workspace gateway, helping organizations manage APIs with workspaces at a lower cost. This feature is being rolled out starting in December 2024 and it may not be available to all eligible services before January. [Learn more](https://aka.ms/apim/workspaces/sharedgateway)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API Management instance.
1. In the left menu, under **APIs**, select **Workspaces**.
1. Select a workspace.
1. In the left menu, under **Deployment + infrastructure**, select **Gateways** > **+ Add**.
1. Complete the wizard to create a gateway. Currently, provisioning of the gateway can take from several minutes to up to 3 hours or longer.
1. After your gateway is provisioned, go to the gateway's **Overview** page. Note the value of **Runtime hostname**. Use this value to update your client apps that call your workspace's APIs.
1. Repeat the preceding steps for your remaining workspaces.

### Update client apps to use the new gateway hostname

After adding a gateway to your workspace, you need to update your client apps that call the workspace's APIs to use the new gateway hostname instead of the gateway hostname of your API Management instance. 

> [!NOTE]
> To help you migrate your workspaces, APIs in workspaces can still be accessed at runtime through October 2024 using the gateway hostname of your API Management instance, even if a workspace gateway is associated with a workspace. We strongly recommend that you complete migration before this date. If your workspace gateways are configured with private inbound access and private outbound access, make sure that connectivity to your API Management instance's built-in gateway is also secured.

### Update dependencies on service-level managed identities

If you're using service-level managed identities in the configuration of workspace entities (for example, named values or certificates), you need to update the configurations. Recommended steps vary depending on the entity. Example: Update named values to use secret values instead of secrets stored in Azure Key Vault.
