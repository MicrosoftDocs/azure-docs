# Limit call rate by subscription

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

The `rate-limit` policy prevents API usage spikes on a per subscription basis by limiting the call rate to a specified number per a specified time period. When the call rate is exceeded, the caller receives a `429 Too Many Requests` response status code.

To understand the difference between rate limits and quotas, [see Rate limits and quotas.](./api-management-sample-flexible-throttling.md#rate-limits-and-quotas)

## Policy statement

```xml
<rate-limit calls="number" renewal-period="seconds"  retry-after-header-name="custom header name, replaces default 'Retry-After'" 
        retry-after-variable-name="policy expression variable name"
        remaining-calls-header-name="header name"  
        remaining-calls-variable-name="policy expression variable name"
        total-calls-header-name="header name">
    <api name="API name" id="API id" calls="number" renewal-period="seconds" >
        <operation name="operation name" id="operation id" calls="number" renewal-period="seconds" />
    </api>

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| api        | Add one or more of these elements to impose a call rate limit on APIs within the product. Product and API call rate limits are applied independently. API can be referenced either via `name` or `id`. If both attributes are provided, `id` will be used and `name` will be ignored.                    | No       |
| operation  | Add one or more of these elements to impose a call rate limit on operations within an API. Product, API, and operation call rate limits are applied independently. Operation can be referenced either via `name` or `id`. If both attributes are provided, `id` will be used and `name` will be ignored. | No       |

## Usage

- [**Policy sections:**](./api-management-howto-policies.md#sections) inbound
- [**Policy scopes:**](./api-management-howto-policies.md#scopes) product, API, operation
-  [**Gateways:**](api-management-gateways-overview.md) classic, v2, consumption, self-hosted, workspace

### Usage notes

* This policy can be used only once per policy definition.
* This policy is only applied when an API is accessed using a subscription key.
* [!INCLUDE [api-management-self-hosted-gateway-rate-limit](../../includes/api-management-self-hosted-gateway-rate-limit.md)] [Learn more](how-to-self-hosted-gateway-on-kubernetes-in-production.md#request-throttling)


## Example

In the following example, the per subscription rate limit is 20 calls per 90 seconds. After each policy execution, the remaining calls allowed in the time period are stored in the variable `remainingCallsPerSubscription`.

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <rate-limit calls="20" renewal-period="90" remaining-calls-variable-name="remainingCallsPerSubscription"/>
    </inbound>
    <outbound>
        <base />
    </outbound>
</policies>
```
