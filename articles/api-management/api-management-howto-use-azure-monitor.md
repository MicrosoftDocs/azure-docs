# Tutorial: Monitor published APIs

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

With Azure Monitor, you can visualize, query, route, archive, and take actions on the metrics or logs coming from your Azure API Management service. For an overview of Azure Monitor for API Management, see [Monitor API Management](monitor-api-management.md).

[!INCLUDE [api-management-workspace-try-it](../../includes/api-management-workspace-try-it.md)]

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * View metrics of your API
> * Set up an alert rule
> * View activity logs
> * Enable and view resource logs

> [!NOTE]
> API Management supports a range of additional tools to observe APIs, including [built-in analytics](howto-use-analytics.md) and integration with [Application Insights](api-management-howto-app-insights.md). [Learn more](observability.md)
> 
## Prerequisites

+ Learn the [Azure API Management terminology](api-management-terminology.md).
+ Complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
+ Also, complete the following tutorial: [Import and publish your first API](import-and-publish.md).

## View metrics of your APIs

API Management emits [metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics) every minute, giving you near real-time visibility into the state and health of your APIs. The following are the most frequently used metrics. For a list of all available metrics, see [Metrics](monitor-api-management-reference.md#metrics).

* **Capacity** - helps you make decisions about upgrading/downgrading your API Management services. The metric is emitted per minute and reflects the estimated gateway capacity at the time of reporting. The metric ranges from 0-100 calculated based on gateway resources such as CPU and memory utilization and other factors.

    > [!TIP]
    > In the [v2 service tiers](v2-service-tiers-overview.md) and in [workspace gateways](workspaces-overview.md#workspace-gateway), API Management has replaced the gateway capacity metric with separate CPU and memory utilization metrics. These metrics can also be used for scaling decisions and troubleshooting. [Learn more](api-management-capacity.md)

* **Requests** - helps you analyze API traffic going through your API Management services. The metric is emitted per minute and reports the number of gateway requests with dimensions. Filter requests by response codes, location, hostname, and errors.

> [!NOTE]
> The Requests metric is not available in workspaces.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following metrics have been retired: Total Gateway Requests, Successful Gateway Requests, Unauthorized Gateway Requests, Failed Gateway Requests, Other Gateway Requests. Please migrate to the Requests metric which provides closely similar functionality.

To access metrics:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API Management instance. On the **Overview** page, on the **Monitor** tab, review key metrics for your APIs.
1. To investigate metrics in detail, select **Monitoring** > **Metrics** from the left menu.

    :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor/api-management-metrics-blade.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Metrics item in Monitoring menu in the portal.":::

    > [!TIP]
    > In a workspace, you can view capacity metrics scoped to a workspace gateway. Navigate to **Monitoring** > **Metrics** in the left menu of a workspace gateway.

1. From the drop-down, select metrics you're interested in. For example, **Requests**.
1. The chart shows the total number of API calls. Adjust the time range to focus on periods of interest.
1. You can filter the chart using the dimensions of the **Requests** metric. For example, select **Add filter**, select **Backend Response Code Category**, enter `500` as the value. The chart shows the number of requests failed in the API backend.

## Set up an alert rule

You can receive [alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview) based on metrics and activity logs. In Azure Monitor, [configure an alert rule](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-create-new-alert-rule) to perform an action when it triggers. Common actions include:

* Send an email notification
* Call a webhook
* Invoke an Azure Logic App

To configure an example alert rule based on a request metric:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API Management instance.
1. Select **Monitoring** > **Alerts** from the left menu.

    :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor/alert-menu-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Alerts option in Monitoring menu in the portal.":::

1. Select **+ Create** > **Alert rule**.
1. On the **Condition** tab:
    1. In **Signal name**, select **Requests**.
    1. In **Alert logic**, review or modify the default values for the alert. For example, update the static **Threshold**, which is the number of occurrences after which the alert should be triggered.
    1. In **Split by dimensions**, in **Dimension name**, select **Gateway Response Code Category**.
    1. In **Dimension values**, select **4xx**, for client errors such as unauthorized or invalid requests. If the dimension value doesn't appear, select **Add custom value** and enter **4xx**.
    1. In **When to evaluate**, accept the default settings, or select other settings to configure how often the rule runs. Select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor/threshold-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of configuring alert logic in the portal.":::

1. On the **Actions** tab, select or create one or more *action groups* to notify users about the alert and take an action. For example, create a new action group to send a notification email to `admin@contoso.com`. For detailed steps, see [Create and manage action groups in the Azure portal](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups).

    :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor/action-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of configuring notifications for new action group in the portal.":::

1. On the **Details** tab of **Create an alert rule**, enter a name and description of the alert rule and select the severity level.
1. Optionally configure the remaining settings. Then, on the **Review + create** tab, select **Create**.
1. Optionally test the alert rule by using an HTTP client to simulate a request that triggers the alert. For example, run the following command in a terminal, substituting the API Management hostname with the hostname of your API Management instance:

    ```bash
    curl GET https://contoso.azure-api.net/non-existent-endpoint HTTP/1.1 
    ```

    An alert triggers based on the evaluation period, and it will send email to admin@contoso.com. 

    Alerts also appear on the **Alerts** page for the API Management instance.

## Activity logs

Activity logs provide insight into the operations on your API Management services. Using activity logs, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) taken on your API Management services.

> [!NOTE]
> Activity logs do not include read (GET) operations or operations performed in the Azure portal.

You can access activity logs in your API Management service, or access logs of all your Azure resources in Azure Monitor. 

:::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor/api-management-activity-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of activity log in portal.":::

To view the activity log:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API Management instance.

1. Select **Activity log**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor/api-management-activity-logs-blade.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Activity log item in Monitoring menu in the portal.":::
1. Select the desired filtering scope and then **Apply**.

## Resource logs

Resource logs (Azure Monitor logs) provide rich information about API Management operations and errors that are important for auditing and troubleshooting purposes. When enabled through a diagnostic setting, the logs collect information about the API requests that are received and processed by the API Management gateway.

> [!NOTE]
> The Consumption tier doesn't support the collection of resource logs.

> [!TIP]
> In API Management instances with [workspaces](workspaces-overview.md), federated logs across the API Management service can be accessed by the API platform team for centralized API monitoring, while workspace teams can access the logs specific to their workspace's APIs. [Learn more about Azure Monitor logging with workspaces](how-to-create-workspace.md#enable-diagnostic-settings-for-monitoring-workspace-apis)
