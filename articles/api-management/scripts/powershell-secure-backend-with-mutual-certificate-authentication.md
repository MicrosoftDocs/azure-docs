# Secure backend

This sample script secures backend with mutual certificate authentication.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-powershell.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-powershell.md)]

If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 3.6 or later. Run ` Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Login-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Sample script
