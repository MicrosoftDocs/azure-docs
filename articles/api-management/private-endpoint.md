# Connect privately to API Management using an inbound private endpoint

[!INCLUDE [premium-dev-standard-standardv2-basic.md](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-standardv2-basic.md)]

You can configure an inbound [private endpoint](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) for your API Management instance to allow clients in your private network to securely access the instance over [Azure Private Link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> Private endpoint support in the Standard v2 tier is currently in preview. 

* The private endpoint uses an IP address from an Azure virtual network in which it's hosted.

* Network traffic between a client on your private network and API Management traverses over the virtual network and a Private Link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet.

* Configure custom DNS settings or an Azure DNS private zone to map the API Management hostname to the endpoint's private IP address.

[!INCLUDE [api-management-private-endpoint](../../includes/api-management-private-endpoint.md)]

## Limitations

* Only the API Management instance's **Gateway endpoint** supports inbound Private Link connections. 
* Each API Management instance supports at most 100 Private Link connections.
* Connections aren't supported on the [self-hosted gateway](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md) or on a [workspace gateway](workspaces-overview.md#workspace-gateway). 
* In the classic API Management tiers, private endpoints aren't supported in instances injected in an internal or external virtual network.

## Typical scenarios

Use an inbound private endpoint to enable private-only access directly to the API Management gateway to limit exposure of sensitive data or backends.

Supported configurations include:

* Pass client requests through a firewall and configure rules to route requests privately to the API Management gateway.
* Configure Azure Front Door (or Azure Front Door with Azure Application Gateway) to receive external traffic and then route traffic privately to the API Management gateway. For example, see [Connect Azure Front Door Premium to an Azure API Management with Private Link](../frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-enable-private-link-apim.md).


## Prerequisites

- An existing API Management instance. [Create one if you haven't already](get-started-create-service-instance.md). 
    - When using an instance in the classic Developer or Premium tier, don't deploy (inject) the instance into an [external](api-management-using-with-vnet.md) or [internal](api-management-using-with-internal-vnet.md) virtual network.
- A virtual network containing a subnet to host the private endpoint. The subnet may contain other Azure resources, but it can't be delegated to another service. 
- (Recommended) A virtual machine in the same or a different subnet in the virtual network, to test the private endpoint.
[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

## Approval method for private endpoint

Typically, a network administrator creates a private endpoint. Depending on your Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permissions, a private endpoint that you create is either *automatically approved* to send traffic to the API Management instance, or requires the resource owner to *manually approve* the connection.


|Approval method     |Minimum RBAC permissions  |
|---------|---------|
|Automatic     | `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/networkinterfaces/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/locations/availablePrivateEndpointTypes/read`<br/>`Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/**`<br/>`Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/privateEndpointConnections/**`        |
|Manual     | `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/networkinterfaces/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/locations/availablePrivateEndpointTypes/read`           |

## Steps to configure private endpoint

1. [Get available private endpoint types in subscription](#get-available-private-endpoint-types-in-subscription)
1. [Create private endpoint - portal](#create-private-endpoint---portal)

### Get available private endpoint types in subscription

Verify that the API Management private endpoint type is available in your subscription and location. In the portal, find this information by going to the **Private Link Center**. Select **Supported resources**.  

You can also find this information by using the [Available Private Endpoint Types - List](/rest/api/virtualnetwork/available-private-endpoint-types) REST API.

```rest
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Network/locations/{region}/availablePrivateEndpointTypes?api-version=2021-03-01
```

Output should include the `Microsoft.ApiManagement.service` endpoint type:

```JSON
[...]

      "name": "Microsoft.ApiManagement.service",
      "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Network/AvailablePrivateEndpointTypes/Microsoft.ApiManagement.service",
      "type": "Microsoft.Network/AvailablePrivateEndpointTypes",
      "resourceName": "Microsoft.ApiManagement/service",
      "displayName": "Microsoft.ApiManagement/service",
      "apiVersion": "2021-04-01-preview"
    }
[...]
```

### Create private endpoint - portal

You can create a private endpoint when you create an API Management instance in the Azure portal, or you can add a private endpoint to an existing instance. You can also create a private endpoint using the [Private Link Center](/azure/private-link/create-private-endpoint-portal).

#### [Classic](#tab/classic)

To add a private endpoint to an existing API Management instance:

1. Navigate to your API Management service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the left-hand menu, under **Deployment + infrastructure**, select **Network**.

1. Select **Inbound private endpoint connections** > **+ Add endpoint**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/private-endpoint/add-endpoint-from-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add a private endpoint using the Azure portal.":::

1. In the **Basics** tab, enter or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** | |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select an existing resource group, or create a new one. It must be in the same region as your virtual network.|
    | **Instance details** |  |
    | Name  | Enter a name for the endpoint such as *myPrivateEndpoint*. |
    | Network Interface Name | Enter a name for the network interface, such as *myInterface* |
    | Region | Select a location for the private endpoint. It must be in the same region as your virtual network. It may differ from the region where your API Management instance is hosted. |

1. Select the **Next: Resource** button at the bottom of the screen. The following information about your API Management instance is already populated:
    * Subscription
    * Resource type
    * Resource name
    
1. In **Resource**, in **Target sub-resource**, select **Gateway**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/private-endpoint/create-private-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing settings to create a private endpoint in the Azure portal.":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Only the **Gateway** sub-resource is supported for API Management. Other sub-resources aren't supported.

1. Select the **Next: Virtual Network** button at the bottom of the screen.

1. In **Virtual Network**, enter or select this information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Virtual network | Select your virtual network. |
    | Subnet | Select your subnet. |
    | Private IP configuration | In most cases, select **Dynamically allocate IP address.** |
    | Application security group | Optionally select an [application security group](../virtual-network/application-security-groups.md). |

1. Select the **Next: DNS** button at the bottom of the screen.

1. In **Private DNS integration**, enter or select this information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Integrate with private DNS zone | Leave the default of **Yes**. |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select your resource group. |
    | Private DNS zones | The default value is displayed: **(new) privatelink.azure-api.net**.

1. Select the **Next: Tabs** button at the bottom of the screen. If you desire, enter tags to organize your Azure resources.

1. Select the **Next: Review + create** button at the bottom of the screen. Select **Create**.


### List private endpoint connections to the instance

After the private endpoint is created and the service updated, it appears in the list on the API Management instance's **Inbound private endpoint connections** page in the portal.


Note the endpoint's **Connection state**:

* **Approved** indicates that the API Management resource automatically approved the connection. 
* **Pending** indicates that the connection must be manually approved by the resource owner.

### Approve pending private endpoint connections

If a private endpoint connection is in a pending state, an owner of the API Management instance must manually approve it before it can be used.

If you have sufficient permissions, approve a private endpoint connection on the API Management instance's **Private endpoint connections** page in the portal. In the connection's context (...) menu, select **Approve**.

You can also use the API Management [Private Endpoint Connection - Create Or Update](/rest/api/apimanagement/private-endpoint-connection/create-or-update) REST API to approve pending private endpoint connections.

---

## Optionally disable public network access

To optionally limit incoming traffic to the API Management instance only to private endpoints, disable the public network access property. You can only disable public network access after you've configured a private endpoint. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Public network access can only be disabled in API Management instances configured with a private endpoint, not with other networking configurations.

#### [Classic](#tab/classic)

To disable the public network access property in the classic tiers using the Azure CLI, run the following [az apim update](/cli/azure/apim#az-apim-update) command, substituting the names of your API Management instance and resource group:

```azurecli
az apim update --name my-apim-service --resource-group my-resource-group --public-network-access false
```

You can also use the [API Management Service - Update](/rest/api/apimanagement/api-management-service/update) REST API to disable public network access, by setting the `publicNetworkAccess` property to `Disabled`.

#### [Standard v2](#tab/v2)

You can use the portal to disable the public network access property in a Standard v2 instance.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to your API Management Standard v2 instance.

1. In the left-hand menu, under **Deployment + infrastructure**, select **Network** > **Edit**.

1. Under **Inbound features**, in the **Public network access** section, select **Disable**.

---

## Validate private endpoint connection

After the private endpoint is created, confirm its DNS settings in the portal.

#### [Classic](#tab/classic)

1. Navigate to your API Management service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the left-hand menu, under **Deployment + infrastructure**, select **Network** > **Inbound private endpoint connections**, and select the private endpoint you created.

1. In the left-hand navigation, under **Settings**, select **DNS configuration**.

1. Review the DNS records and IP address of the private endpoint. The IP address is a private address in the address space of the subnet where the private endpoint is configured.


#### [Standard v2](#tab/v2)

1. Navigate to your API Management service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the left-hand menu, under **Deployment + infrastructure**, select **Network** > **Edit**, and select the private endpoint you created.

1. On the **Private endpoint** page, review the endpoint's virtual network and private DNS integration settings.

### Test in virtual network

Connect to a virtual machine you set up in the virtual network.

Run a utility such as `nslookup` or `dig` to look up the IP address of your default Gateway endpoint over Private Link. For example:

```
nslookup my-apim-service.privatelink.azure-api.net
```

Output should include the private IP address associated with the private endpoint.

API calls initiated within the virtual network to the default Gateway endpoint should succeed.

### Test from internet

From outside the private endpoint path, attempt to call the API Management instance's default Gateway endpoint. If public access is disabled, output includes an error with status code `403` and a message similar to:

```
Request originated from client public IP address 192.0.2.12, public network access on this 'Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/my-apim-service' is disabled.
       
To connect to 'Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/my-apim-service', please use the Private Endpoint from inside your virtual network. 
```
