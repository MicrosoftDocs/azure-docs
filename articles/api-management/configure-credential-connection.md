# Configure multiple connections

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

You can configure multiple connections to a credential provider in your API Management instance. For example, if you configured Microsoft Entra ID as a credential provider, you might need to create multiple connections for different scenarios and users.

In this article, you learn how to add a connection to an existing provider, using credential manager in the portal. For an overview of credential manager, see [About API credentials and credential manager](credentials-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

* An API Management instance. If you need to, [create one](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
* A configured credential provider. For example, see the steps to create a provider for [GitHub](credentials-how-to-github.md) or [Microsoft Entra ID](credentials-how-to-azure-ad.md).
 
## Create a connection - portal

1. Sign into the [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to your API Management instance.
1. In the left menu, select **Credential manager**.
1. Select the credential provider that you want to create multiple connections for (for example, *mygithub*).
1. In the provider window, select **Overview** > **+ Create connection**.
