# Configure users of the developer portal to authenticate using usernames and passwords 

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic-premiumv2-standardv2-basicv2](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic-premiumv2-standardv2-basicv2.md)]

In the developer portal for Azure API Management, the default authentication method for users is to provide a username and password. In this article, learn how to set up users with basic authentication credentials to the developer portal.

For an overview of options to secure the developer portal, see [Secure access to the API Management developer portal](secure-developer-portal-access.md). 

> [!CAUTION]
> While you can use basic authentication to secure users' access to the developer portal, we recommend configuring a more secure authentication method such as [Microsoft Entra ID](api-management-howto-aad.md) or [Azure AD B2C](api-management-howto-aad-b2c.md), if available. 

## Prerequisites

- Complete the [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md) quickstart.

[!INCLUDE [api-management-navigate-to-instance.md](../../includes/api-management-navigate-to-instance.md)]


## Confirm the username and password provider

By default, the username and password *identity provider* is enabled in the developer portal. To confirm this setting:

1. In the left menu of your API Management instance, under **Developer portal**, select **Identities**.
1. In the **Provider type** list, confirm that **Username and password** appears.

If the provider isn't already enabled, you can add it:

1. In the left menu of your API Management instance, under **Developer portal**, select **Identities** > **+ Add**.
1. Under **Type**, select **Username and password**, and then select **Add**.

## Add a username and password

There are two ways to add a username and password for authentication to the developer portal:

* An API publisher can add a user through the Azure portal, or with equivalent Azure tools such as the [New-AzApiManagementUser](/powershell/module/az.apimanagement/new-azapimanagementuser) Azure PowerShell cmdlet. For steps to use the portal, see [How to manage user accounts in Azure API Management](api-management-howto-create-or-invite-developers.md).

* An API consumer (developer) can sign up directly in the developer portal, using the **Sign up** page.

> [!NOTE]
> API Management enforces password strength requirements including password length. When you add a user in the Azure portal, the password must be at least 6 characters long. When a developer signs up or resets a password through the developer portal, the password must be at least 8 characters long.

## Delete the username and password provider

If you've configured another identity provider for the developer portal such as [Microsoft Entra ID](api-management-howto-aad.md) or [Azure AD B2C](api-management-howto-aad-b2c.md), you might want to delete the username and password provider. 

Deleting the identity provider prevents adding users to use username and password authentication. Existing users configured for basic authentication are also prevented from signing into the developer portal.

1. In the left menu of your API Management instance, under **Developer portal**, select **Identities**.
1. In the **Provider type** list, select **Username and password**. In the context menu (**...**), select **Delete**.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to disable all sign up or sign in functionality in the developer portal, see [How do I disable sign up in the developer portal?](developer-portal-faq.md#how-do-i-disable-sign-up-in-the-developer-portal)
