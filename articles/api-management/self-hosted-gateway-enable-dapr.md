# Enable Dapr support in the self-hosted gateway

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-dev](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev.md)]

Dapr integration in API Management enables operations teams to directly expose Dapr microservices deployed on Kubernetes clusters as APIs, and make those APIs discoverable and easily consumable by developers with proper controls across multiple Dapr deploymentsâ€”whether in the cloud, on-premises, or on the edge.

## About Dapr

Dapr is a portable runtime for building stateless and stateful microservices-based applications with any language or framework. It codifies the common microservice patterns, like service discovery and invocation with built-in retry logic, publish-and-subscribe with at-least-once delivery semantics, or pluggable binding resources to ease composition using external services. Go to [dapr.io](https://dapr.io) for detailed information and instruction on how to get started with Dapr.

## Enable Dapr support

To turn on Dapr support in the API Management self-hosted gateway, add the following [Dapr annotations](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/arguments-annotations-overview/) to the [Kubernetes deployment template](how-to-deploy-self-hosted-gateway-kubernetes.md), replacing `app-name` with a desired name. A complete walkthrough of setting up and using API Management with Dapr is available [here](https://aka.ms/apim/dapr/walkthru).

```yml
template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app-name
      annotations:
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/app-id: "app-name"
```
> [!TIP]
> You can also deploy the [self-hosted gateway with Helm](how-to-deploy-self-hosted-gateway-kubernetes-helm.md) and use the Dapr configuration options.

## Dapr integration policies

API Management provides specific [policies](api-management-policies.md#integration-and-external-communication) to interact with Dapr APIs exposed through the self-hosted gateway.
