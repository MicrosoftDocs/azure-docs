# Deploy an Azure API Management self-hosted gateway to Docker

This article provides the steps for deploying self-hosted gateway component of Azure API Management to a Docker environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Hosting self-hosted gateway in Docker is best suited for evaluation and development use cases. Kubernetes is recommended for production use. See [this](how-to-deploy-self-hosted-gateway-kubernetes.md) document to learn how to deploy self-hosted gateway to Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md)
- Create a Docker environment. [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is a good option for development and evaluation purposes. See [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com) for information on all Docker editions, their features, and comprehensive documentation on Docker itself.
- [Provision a gateway resource in your API Management instance](api-management-howto-provision-self-hosted-gateway.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Self-hosted gateway is packaged as a x86-64 Linux-based Docker container.

## Deploy the self-hosted gateway to Docker

1. Select **Gateways** from under **Deployment and infrastructure**.
2. Select the gateway resource you intend to deploy.
3. Select **Deployment**.
4. Note that an access token in the **Token** text box was autogenerated for you using the default **Expiry** and **Secret key** values. If needed, pick desired values in either or both controls to generate a new token.
4. Make sure **Docker** is selected under **Deployment scripts**.
5. Select **env.conf** file link next to the **Environment** to download the file.
6. Select **copy** icon located at the right end of the **Run** text box to copy the Docker command to clipboard.
7. Paste the command to the terminal (or command) window. Adjust the port mappings and container name as needed. Note that the command assumes that downloaded environment file is present in the current directory.
```
    docker run -d -p 80:8080 -p 443:8081 --name <gateway-name> --env-file env.conf mcr.microsoft.com/azure-api-management/gateway:<tag>
```
8. Execute the command. The command instructs your Docker environment to run the container using [container image](https://aka.ms/apim/sputnik/dhub) downloaded from the Microsoft Container Registry, and to map the container's HTTP (8080) and HTTPS (8081) ports to ports 80 and 443 on the host.
9. Run the below command to check if the gateway container is running:
```console
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                         NAMES
895ef0ecf13b        mcr.microsoft.com/azure-api-management/gateway:latest   "/bin/sh -c 'dotnet …"   5 seconds ago       Up 3 seconds        0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->8081/tcp   my-gateway
```
10. Go back to Azure portal, click on **Overview** and confirm that self-hosted gateway container you just deployed is reporting a healthy status.

> [!TIP]
> Use <code>console docker container logs <gateway-name></code> command to view a snapshot of self-hosted gateway log.
>
> Use <code>docker container logs --help</code> command to see all log viewing options.
