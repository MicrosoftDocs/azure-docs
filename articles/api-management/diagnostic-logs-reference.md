# Diagnostics logs settings reference: API Management

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

This reference describes settings for API diagnostics logging from an API Management instance. To enable logging of API requests, see the following guidance:

* [Collect resource logs](api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor.md#resource-logs)
* [Integrate Azure API Management with Azure Application Insights](api-management-howto-app-insights.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Certain settings, where noted, apply only to logging to Application Insights.
