# Get value from cache

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

Use the `cache-lookup-value` policy to perform cache lookup by key and return a cached value. The key can have an arbitrary string value and is typically provided using a policy expression.

> [!NOTE]
> This policy must have a corresponding [Store value in cache](cache-store-value-policy.md) policy.

[!INCLUDE [api-management-cache-volatile](../../includes/api-management-cache-volatile.md)]

[!INCLUDE [api-management-policy-generic-alert](../../includes/api-management-policy-generic-alert.md)]

## Policy statement

```xml
<cache-lookup-value key="cache key value"
    default-value="value to use if cache lookup resulted in a miss"
    variable-name="name of a variable looked up value is assigned to"
    caching-type="prefer-external | external | internal" />
```
