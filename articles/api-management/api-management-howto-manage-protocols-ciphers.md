# Manage protocols and ciphers in Azure API Management

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

Azure API Management supports multiple versions of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to secure API traffic for:
* Client side
* Backend side

API Management also supports multiple cipher suites used by the API gateway.

By default, API Management enables TLS 1.2 for client and backend connectivity and several supported cipher suites. This guide shows you how to manage protocols and ciphers configuration for an Azure API Management instance.

> [!NOTE]
> * If you're using the self-hosted gateway, see [self-hosted gateway security](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#security) to manage TLS protocols and cipher suites.
> * The following tiers don't support changes to the default cipher configuration: **Consumption**, **Basic v2**, **Standard v2**, **Premium v2**. 
> * In [workspaces](workspaces-overview.md), the managed gateway doesn't support changes to the default protocol and cipher configuration.

## Prerequisites

* An API Management instance. [Create one if you haven't already](get-started-create-service-instance.md).

[!INCLUDE [api-management-navigate-to-instance.md](../../includes/api-management-navigate-to-instance.md)]

## How to manage TLS protocols cipher suites

1. In the left navigation of your API Management instance, under **Security**, select **Protocols + ciphers**.  
1. Enable or disable desired protocols or ciphers.
1. Select **Save**.

Changes can take 1 hour or longer to apply. An instance in the Developer service tier has downtime during the process. Instances in the Basic and higher tiers don't have downtime during the process.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some protocols or cipher suites (such as backend-side TLS 1.2) can't be enabled or disabled from the Azure portal. Instead, you'll need to apply the REST API call. Use the `properties.customProperties` structure in the [Create/Update API Management Service](/rest/api/apimanagement/current-ga/api-management-service/create-or-update) REST API.
