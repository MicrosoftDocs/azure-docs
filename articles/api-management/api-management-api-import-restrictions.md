# API import restrictions and known issues

## About this list

When importing an API, you might come across some restrictions or identify issues that need to be rectified before you can successfully perform the import. This article documents these limitations, organized by the import format of the API. It also describes how OpenAPI export works.

## <a name="open-api"> </a>OpenAPI/Swagger import limitations

If you're receiving errors importing your OpenAPI document, make sure you've validated it beforehand. You can do that either using the designer in the Azure portal (Design - Front End - OpenAPI Specification Editor), or with a third-party tool such as <a href="https://editor.swagger.io">Swagger Editor</a>.

### <a name="open-api-general"> </a>General

-   Required parameters across both path and query must have unique names. (In OpenAPI a parameter name only needs to be unique within a location, for example path, query, header. However, in API Management we allow operations to be discriminated by both path and query parameters (which OpenAPI doesn't support). That's why we require parameter names to be unique within the entire URL template.)
-   `\$ref` pointers can't reference external files.
-   `x-ms-paths` and `x-servers` are the only supported extensions.
-   Custom extensions are ignored on import and aren't saved or preserved for export.
-   `Recursion` - API Management doesn't support definitions defined recursively (for example, schemas referring to themselves).
-   Source file URL (if available) is applied to relative server URLs.
-   Security definitions are ignored.
-   Inline schema definitions for API operations aren't supported. Schema definitions are defined in the API scope and can be referenced in API operations request or response scopes.
-   A defined URL parameter needs to be part of the URL template.
-   `Produces` keyword, which describes MIME types returned by an API, isn't supported. 

### <a name="open-api-v2"> </a>OpenAPI version 2

-   Only JSON format is supported.

### <a name="open-api-v3"> </a>OpenAPI version 3

-   If many `servers` are specified, API Management will try to select the first HTTPs URL. If there aren't any HTTPs URLs - the first HTTP URL. If there aren't any HTTP URLs - the server URL will be empty.
-   `Examples` isn't supported, but `example` is.

## OpenAPI import, update, and export mechanisms

### Add new API via OpenAPI import

For each operation found in the OpenAPI document, a new operation will be created with Azure resource name and display name set to `operationId` and `summary` respectively. `operationId` value is normalized following the rules described below. `summary` value is imported as-is and its length is limited to 300 characters.

If `operationId` isn't specified (that is, not present, `null`, or empty), Azure resource name value will be generated by combining HTTP method and path template, for example, `get-foo`.

If `summary` isn't specified (that is, not present, `null`, or empty), `display name` value will set to `operationId`. If `operationId` is not specified, display name value will be generated by combining HTTP method and path template, for example, `Get - /foo`.

### Update an existing API via OpenAPI import

During import existing API is changed to match API described in the OpenAPI document. Each operation in the OpenAPI document is matched to existing operation by comparing its `operationId` value to Azure resource name of existing operation.

If a match is found, existing operation’s properties will be updated "in-place".

If a match isn't found a new operation will be created using the rules described in the section above. For each new operation, the import will attempt to copy policies from an existing operation with the same HTTP method and path template.

All existing unmatched operations will be deleted.

To make import more predictable please follow these guidelines:

- Make sure to specify `operationId` property for every operation.
- Refrain from changing `operationId` after initial import.
- Never change `operationId` and HTTP method or path template at the same time.

### Export API as OpenAPI

For each operation, its Azure resource name will be exported as an `operationId`, and display name will be exported as a `summary`.
Normalization rules for operationId

- Convert to lower case.
- Replace each sequence of non-alphanumeric characters with a single dash, for example, `GET-/foo/{bar}?buzz={quix}` will be transformed into `get-foo-bar-buzz-quix-`.
- Trim dashes on both sides, for example, `get-foo-bar-buzz-quix-` will become `get-foo-bar-buzz-quix`
- Truncate to fit 76 characters, four characters less than maximum limit for a resource name.
- Use remaining four characters for a deduplication suffix, if necessary, in the form of `-1, -2, ..., -999`.


## <a name="wsdl"> </a>WSDL

WSDL files are used to create SOAP pass-through and SOAP-to-REST APIs.

-   **SOAP bindings** -Only SOAP bindings of style ”document” and “literal” encoding are supported. There is no support for “rpc” style or SOAP-Encoding.
-   **WSDL:Import** - This attribute isn't supported. Customers should merge the imports into one document.
-   **Messages with multiple parts** - These types of messages aren't supported.
-   **WCF wsHttpBinding** - SOAP services created with Windows Communication Foundation should use basicHttpBinding - wsHttpBinding isn't supported.
-   **MTOM** - Services using MTOM <em>may</em> work. Official support isn't offered at this time.
-   **Recursion** - Types that are defined recursively (for example, refer to an array of themselves) are not supported by APIM.
-   **Multiple Namespaces** - Multiple namespaces can be used in a schema, but only the target namespace can be used to define message parts. Namespaces other than the target, which are used to define other input or output elements, are not preserved. Although such a WSDL document can be imported, on export all message parts will have the target namespace of the WSDL.
-   **Arrays** - SOAP-to-REST transformation supports only wrapped arrays shown in the example below:

```xml
    <complexType name="arrayTypeName">
        <sequence>
            <element name="arrayElementValue" type="arrayElementType" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
        </sequence>
    </complexType>
    <complexType name="typeName">
        <sequence>
            <element name="element1" type="someTypeName" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
            <element name="element2" type="someOtherTypeName" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" nillable="true"/>
            <element name="arrayElement" type="arrayTypeName" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
        </sequence>
    </complexType>
```

## <a name="wadl"> </a>WADL

Currently, there are no known WADL import issues.
