      - question: Local development of my portal is no longer working.
        answer: |
          If the local version of your developer portal can't save or retrieve information from the Storage Account or API Management instance, the SAS tokens may have expired.
          
          You can fix that by generating new tokens. For instructions, refer to the [Configure JSON files, Static website, and CORS settings](dev-portal-self-host-portal.md#configure-json-files-static-website-and-cors-settings) section of the **Self-host the portal** article.
          
      - question: How can I remove provisioned content?
        answer: |
          If you want to remove the content provisioned to your API management service, provide the required parameters in the `scripts/cleanup.bat` script and execute it:
          
          1. Go to the `scripts` folder, where you will find the cleanup.bat script:
          
              ```console
              cd scripts
              ```
          
          1. Open `cleanup.bat` with a text editor and add the required info.
         
          1. After you add the info to cleanup.bat, run it:
          
              ```console
              .\cleanup.bat
              ```
