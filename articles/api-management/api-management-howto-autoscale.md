# Automatically scale an Azure API Management instance

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-standard-basic](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-standard-basic.md)]

An Azure API Management service instance can scale automatically based on a set of rules. This behavior can be enabled and configured through [Azure Monitor autoscale](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-overview#supported-services-for-autoscale).

The article walks through the process of configuring autoscale and suggests optimal configuration of autoscale rules.

> [!NOTE]
> * In service tiers that support multiple scale units, you can also [manually scale](upgrade-and-scale.md) your API Management instance.
> * An API Management service in the **Consumption** tier scales automatically based on the traffic - without any additional configuration needed.
> * Currently, autoscale is not supported for the [workspace gateway](workspaces-overview.md#workspace-gateway) in API Management workspaces.

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps from this article, you must:

+ Have an active Azure subscription.
+ Have an Azure API Management instance. For more information, see [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
+ Understand the concept of [capacity](api-management-capacity.md) of an API Management instance.
+ Understand [manual scaling](upgrade-and-scale.md) of an API Management instance, including cost consequences.

## Azure API Management autoscale limitations

Certain limitations and consequences of scaling decisions need to be considered before configuring autoscale behavior.

+ The [pricing tier](api-management-features.md) of your API Management instance determines the [maximum number of units](upgrade-and-scale.md#upgrade-and-scale) you may scale to. For example, the **Standard tier** can be scaled to 4 units. You can add any number of units to the **Premium** tier.
+ The scaling process takes at least 20 minutes.
+ If the service is locked by another operation, the scaling request will fail and retry automatically.
+ If your service instance is deployed in multiple regions (locations), only units in the **Primary location** can be autoscaled with Azure Monitor autoscale. Units in other locations can only be scaled manually.
+ If your service instance is configured with [availability zones](zone-redundancy.md) in the **Primary location**, be aware of the number of zones when configuring autoscaling. The number of API Management units in autoscale rules and limits must be a multiple of the number of zones. 

## Enable and configure autoscale for an API Management instance

Follow these steps to configure autoscale for an Azure API Management service:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and navigate to your API Management instance.
1. In the left menu, select **Scale out (auto-scale)**, and then select **Custom autoscale**.

1. In the **Default** scale condition, select **Scale based on a metric**, and then select **Add a rule**.

1. Define a new scale-out rule.

   For example, a scale-out rule could trigger addition of 1 API Management unit, when the average capacity metric over the previous 30 minutes exceeds 70%. The following table provides an example configuration for such a rule. Review the preceding [limitations](#azure-api-management-autoscale-limitations) when defining a scale-out rule in your environment.

    | Cool down (minutes)   | 60                | It takes at least 20 minutes for the API Management service to scale out.

1. Select **Add** to save the rule.
1. To add another rule, select **Add a rule**.

    This time, a scale-in rule needs to be defined. It ensures that resources aren't being wasted, when the usage of APIs decreases.

1. Define a new scale-in rule.

    For example, a scale-in rule could trigger a removal of 1 API Management unit when the average capacity metric over the previous 30 minutes is lower than 35%. The following table provides an example configuration for such a rule.
