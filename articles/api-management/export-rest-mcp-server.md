# Expose REST API in API Management as an MCP server

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-standard-basic-premiumv2-standardv2-basicv2](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-standard-basic-premiumv2-standardv2-basicv2.md)]

In API Management, you can expose a REST API managed in API Management as a remote [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) server using its built-in [AI gateway](genai-gateway-capabilities.md). Expose one or more of the API operations as tools that MCP clients can call using the MCP protocol. 

[!INCLUDE [preview-callout-mcp-servers](includes/preview/preview-callout-mcp-servers.md)]

Azure API Management also supports secure integration with existing MCP-compatible servers - tool servers hosted outside of API Management. For more information, see [Expose an existing MCP server](expose-existing-mcp-server.md).

* [AI gateway capabilities](genai-gateway-capabilities.md)


## Limitations

The following limitations apply to this preview. Preview features are subject to change, so check back for updates.
    
* API Management supports MCP server tools, but doesn't support MCP resources or prompts.
* MCP server capabilities aren't supported in API Management [workspaces](workspaces-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

+ If you don't already have an API Management instance, complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md). 
    + The following service tiers are supported for preview: classic Basic, Standard, Premium, Basic v2, Standard v2, or Premium v2.
    + In the classic Basic, Standard, or Premium tier, you must join the **AI Gateway Early** [update group](configure-service-update-settings.md) to access MCP server features. Allow up to 2 hours for the update to be applied.

+ Make sure that your instance manages an HTTP-compatible API (any API imported as a REST API, including APIs imported from Azure resources) that you'd like to expose as an MCP server. To import a sample API, see [Import and publish your first API](import-and-publish.md).
    > [!NOTE]
    > Other API types in API Management that aren't HTTP-compatible can't be exposed as MCP servers.

+ If youâ€™ve enabled diagnostic logging via Application Insights or Azure Monitor at the global scope (All APIs) for your API Management service instance, ensure that the **Number of payload bytes to log** setting for Frontend Response is set to 0. This prevents unintended logging of response bodies across all APIs and helps ensure proper functioning of MCP servers. To log payloads selectively for specific APIs, configure the setting individually at the API scope, allowing targeted control over response logging.

+ To test the MCP server, you can use Visual Studio Code with access to [GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup).


## Expose API as an MCP server

Follow these steps to expose a managed REST API in API Management as an MCP server:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API Management instance.
1. In the left menu, under **APIs**, select **MCP Servers** > **+ Create MCP server**.
1. Select **Expose an API as an MCP server**.
1. In **Backend MCP server**:
    1. Select a managed **API** to expose as an MCP server. 
    1. Select one or more **API operations** to expose as tools. You can select all operations or only specific operations. 
        > [!NOTE]
        > You can update the operations exposed as tools later in the **Tools** blade of your MCP server.
1. In **New MCP server**:
    1. Enter a **Name** for the MCP server in API Management.
    1. Optionally, enter a **Description** for the MCP server.
1. Select **Create**.

* The MCP server is created and the API operations are exposed as tools. 
* The MCP server is listed in the **MCP Servers** blade. The **Server URL** column shows the endpoint of the MCP server to call for testing or within a client application.
