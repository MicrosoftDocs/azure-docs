# Create and manage a workspace in Azure API Management

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium.md)]

Set up a [workspace](workspaces-overview.md) to enable an API team to manage and productize their own APIs, while providing the API platform team with the tools to observe, govern, and maintain the API Management platform. After you create a workspace and assign permissions, workspace collaborators can create and manage their own APIs, products, subscriptions, and related resources.

[!INCLUDE [api-management-workspace-intro-note](../../includes/api-management-workspace-intro-note.md)]

Follow the steps in this article to:

* Create an API Management workspace and associate a workspace gateway using the Azure portal
* Optionally, isolate the workspace gateway in an Azure virtual network
* Assign permissions to the workspace

> [!NOTE]
> * Currently, creating a workspace gateway is a long-running operation that can take up to 3 hours or more to complete. 
> * Associating multiple workspaces with a workspace gateway is available only for workspace gateways created after April 15, 2025. [Learn more about shared workspace gateways](workspaces-overview.md#workspace-gateway).

## Prerequisites

* An API Management instance. If you need to, [create one](get-started-create-service-instance.md) in a supported tier.
* **Owner** or **Contributor** role on the resource group where the API Management instance is deployed, or equivalent permissions to create resources in the resource group.
* (Optional) A subnet in a new or existing Azure virtual network to isolate the workspace gateway's inbound and outbound traffic. For configuration options and requirements, see [Network resource requirements for workspace gateways](virtual-network-workspaces-resources.md).
    
## Create a workspace - portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and navigate to your API Management instance.

1. In the left menu, under **APIs**, select **Workspaces** > **+ Add**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter a descriptive **Display name**, resource **Name**, and optional **Description** for the workspace. Select **Next**.

1. On the **Gateway** tab, configure settings for the workspace gateway.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-workspace/create-workspace-gateway.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a workspace gateway in the portal.":::

    * Select **Create new** to create a new workspace gateway, or select **Use existing** to associate the workspace with an existing gateway that has other workspaces deployed on it.

    * If you choose to create a new gateway:
        * In **Gateway details**, enter a new gateway name and select the number of scale **Units**. The gateway costs are based on the number of units. For more information, see [API Management pricing](https://aka.ms/apimpricing).

        * In **Network**, select a **Network configuration** for your workspace gateway. 
    
          > [!IMPORTANT]
          > Plan your workspace's network configuration carefully. You can't change the network configuration after you create the workspace.
    
        * If you select a network configuration that includes private inbound or private outbound network access, select a **Virtual network** and **Subnet** to isolate the workspace gateway, or create a new one. For network requirements, see [Network resource requirements for workspace gateways](virtual-network-workspaces-resources.md).
    
1. Select **Next**. After validation completes, select **Create**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Creation of a new workspace gateway, if selected, can take up to several hours to complete. To track the deployment progress in the Azure portal, go to the gateway's resource group. In the left menu, under **Settings**, select **Deployments**.

After the deployment completes, the new workspace appears in the list on the **Workspaces** page. Select the workspace to manage its settings and resources.

> [!NOTE]
> * To view the gateway runtime hostname and other gateway details, select the workspace in the portal. Under **Deployment + infrastructure**, select **Gateways**, and select the name of the workspace's gateway.
> * While the workspace gateway is being created, runtime calls to the workspace's APIs won't succeed.

## Assign users to workspace - portal

After creating a workspace, assign permissions to users to manage the workspace's resources. Each workspace user must be assigned both a service-scoped workspace RBAC role and a workspace-scoped RBAC role, or granted equivalent permissions using custom roles. 

To manage the workspace gateway, we recommend also assigning workspace users an Azure-provided RBAC role scoped to the workspace gateway. 

> [!NOTE]
> For easier management, set up Microsoft Entra groups to assign workspace permissions to multiple users.
> 

* For a list of built-in workspace roles, see [How to use role-based access control in API Management](api-management-role-based-access-control.md).
* For steps to assign a role, see [Assign Azure roles using the portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.yml?tabs=current).


### Assign a service-scoped role

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and navigate to your API Management instance.

1. In the left menu, select **Access control (IAM)** > **+ Add**.

1. Assign one of the following service-scoped roles to each member of the workspace:

    * **API Management Service Workspace API Developer**
    * **API Management Service Workspace API Product Manager**

### Assign a workspace-scoped role

1. In the menu for your API Management instance, under **APIs**, select **Workspaces** > the name of the workspace that you created.
1. In the **Workspace** window, select **Access control (IAM)**> **+ Add**.
    
1. Assign one of the following workspace-scoped roles to the workspace members so that they can manage workspace APIs and other resources. 

    * **API Management Workspace Reader**
    * **API Management Workspace Contributor**
    * **API Management Workspace API Developer**
    * **API Management Workspace API Product Manager**

### Assign a gateway-scoped role

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and navigate to your API Management instance.

1. In the left menu, under **APIs**, select **Workspaces**  > the name of your workspace.

1. In the left menu of the workspace, select **Gateways**, and select the workspace gateway. 

1. In the left menu, select **Access control (IAM)** > **+ Add**.

1. Assign one of the following roles to each member of the workspace. At minimum, we recommend assigning the **Reader** role to view the gateway's settings. **Owners** and **Contributors** can manage the gateway's settings including scaling the gateway.
    
    * **Owner**
    * **Contributor**
    * **Reader** 

## Enable diagnostic settings for monitoring workspace APIs

Configure settings to collect Azure Monitor logs for the workspace and send them to a Log Analytics workspace so that the workspace team can monitor their own APIs while the API platform team can access centralized logs for the API Management instance. See the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-workspace/federated-logs.png" alt-text="Diagram of federated logging in API Management.":::

To collect Azure Monitor logs for the workspace, diagnostic settings are needed at both the service and workspace levels:

1. First, enable a diagnostics setting at the *service level* for collection of API Management gateway logs, if a setting isn't already enabled. We recommend sending logs to a Log Analytics workspace. For more information, see [Configure diagnostic settings for API Management](api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor.md#resource-logs).

1. Then, enable a diagnostics setting at the *workspace level* to send API Management gateway logs to the same Log Analytics workspace. This setting collects logs for all workspace gateways associated with the workspace. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > A diagnostic setting at the service level configures logging across the API Management instance, including workspaces that have a workspace-level diagnostic setting enabled. If you don't enable a workspace-level diagnostic setting, the workspace's gateway logs won't be collected or aggregated into Log Analytics.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, members of the workspace team assigned the built-in workspace RBAC roles don't have permissions to edit diagnostic settings in a workspace. The API platform team has those permissions. 

To configure a workspace diagnostic setting for collection of workspace-level gateway logs:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and navigate to your API Management instance.

1. In the left menu, under **APIs**, select **Workspaces**  > the name of your workspace.

1. In the left menu of the workspaces, under **Monitoring**, select **Diagnostic settings** > **+ Add diagnostic setting**.

1. On the **Diagnostic setting** page, enter or select details for the setting:

    1. **Diagnostic setting name**: Enter a descriptive name.
    1. **Category groups**: Optionally make a selection for your scenario.
    1. Under **Categories**: Select **Logs related to ApiManagement Gateway** to collect gateway logs for APIs in this workspace.
    1. Under **Destination details**, select to send logs to the same Azure Log Analytics workspace specified in the service-level diagnostic setting and in other workspace-level diagnostic settings. 
    1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> * Currently, only gateway logs can be collected for workspaces.
> * Access workspace-level logs by navigating to **Monitoring** > **Logs** in the left menu of the workspace.
    

## Get started with your workspace

Depending on their role in the workspace, users might have permissions to create APIs, products, subscriptions, and other resources, or they might have read-only access to some or all of them.
