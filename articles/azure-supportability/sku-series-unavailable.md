# SKU series unavailable
In some regions, certain SKUs are not automatically available on new subscriptions.  This may occur when [more powerful SKUs are introduced in a region](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/announcing-new-dv2-series-virtual-machine-size/) and the popularity of the legacy SKU declines.
The message "*Some SKU series are unavailable for the selected subscription for this region*" is displayed when creating a support request to increase compute core quota.

You may review SKU availability on the [Azure services by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/#services) page. 

To request access to a SKU that has been restricted from your subscription, create a "Subscription Management" support request.

* On the Basics page, select Issue type as "Subscription Management" and click "Next".

* On the Problem page, select the Problem type as “Other General questions” and enter the exact region and SKU you aren’t seeing.
  This helps expedite the support process.
