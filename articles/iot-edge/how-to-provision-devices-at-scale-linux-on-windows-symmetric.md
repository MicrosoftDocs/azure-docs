# Create and provision IoT Edge for Linux on Windows devices at scale using symmetric keys

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-all-supported](includes/iot-edge-version-all-supported.md)]

This article shows how to autoprovision one or more [IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows.md) devices using symmetric keys. Automatically provision Azure IoT Edge devices with the [Azure IoT Hub device provisioning service](../iot-dps/index.yml) (DPS). If you're unfamiliar with the process of autoprovisioning, review the [provisioning overview](../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md#provisioning-process) before continuing.


Here are the tasks:

1. Create either an **individual enrollment** for a single device or a **group enrollment** for a set of devices.
1. Deploy a Linux virtual machine with the IoT Edge runtime installed and connect it to the IoT Hub.

Symmetric key attestation is a simple way to authenticate a device with a device provisioning service instance. This attestation method is a "Hello world" experience for developers who are new to device provisioning or don't have strict security requirements. Device attestation using a [TPM](../iot-dps/concepts-tpm-attestation.md) or [X.509 certificates](../iot-dps/concepts-x509-attestation.md) is more secure, and you should use it for more stringent security requirements.

## Prerequisites

<!-- Cloud resources prerequisites H3 and content -->
[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-prerequisites-at-scale-cloud-resources.md](includes/iot-edge-prerequisites-at-scale-cloud-resources.md)]

<!-- IoT Edge for Linux on Windows installation prerequisites H3 and content -->
[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-prerequisites-linux-on-windows.md](includes/iot-edge-prerequisites-linux-on-windows.md)]

<!-- Create a DPS enrollment using symmetric keys H2 and content -->
[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-create-dps-enrollment-symmetric.md](includes/iot-edge-create-dps-enrollment-symmetric.md)]

<!-- Install IoT Edge for Linux on Windows H2 and content -->
[!INCLUDE [install-iot-edge-linux-on-windows.md](includes/iot-edge-install-linux-on-windows.md)]

## Provision the device with its cloud identity

After you install the runtime on your device, configure the device with the information it uses to connect to the device provisioning service and IoT Hub.

Make sure you have the following information:

* The DPS **ID Scope** value
* The device **Registration ID** you created
* The **Primary Key** from an individual enrollment, or a [derived key](#derive-a-device-key) for devices using a group enrollment.

Run the following command in an elevated PowerShell session with the placeholder values updated with your own values:

```powershell
Provision-EflowVm -provisioningType DpsSymmetricKey -scopeId PASTE_YOUR_ID_SCOPE_HERE -registrationId PASTE_YOUR_REGISTRATION_ID_HERE -symmKey PASTE_YOUR_PRIMARY_KEY_OR_DERIVED_KEY_HERE
```

## Verify successful installation

Check that IoT Edge for Linux on Windows is installed and set up on your IoT Edge device.

# [Individual enrollment](#tab/individual-enrollment)

Check that the individual enrollment you created in device provisioning service is used. Go to your device provisioning service instance in the Azure portal. Open the enrollment details for the individual enrollment you created. The status of the enrollment is **assigned**, and the device ID is listed.

# [Group enrollment](#tab/group-enrollment)

Check that the group enrollment you created in device provisioning service is used. Go to your device provisioning service instance in the Azure portal. Open the enrollment details for the group enrollment you created. Go to the **Registration Records** tab to view all devices registered in that group.

1. Sign in to your IoT Edge for Linux on Windows virtual machine using the following command in your PowerShell session:

   ```powershell
   Connect-EflowVm
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >The only account allowed to SSH to the virtual machine is the user that created it.

1. Once you're logged in, you can check the list of running IoT Edge modules using the following Linux command:

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge list
   ```

1. If you need to troubleshoot the IoT Edge service, use the following Linux commands.

    1. Retrieve the service logs.

       ```bash
       sudo iotedge system logs
       ```

    2. Use the `check` tool to verify configuration and connection status of the device.

       ```bash
       sudo iotedge check
       ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >On a newly provisioned device, you may see an error related to IoT Edge Hub:
    >
    >**× production readiness: Edge Hub's storage directory is persisted on the host filesystem - Error**
    >
    >**Could not check current state of edgeHub container**
    >
    >This error is expected on a newly provisioned device because the IoT Edge Hub module isn't running. To fix the error, in IoT Hub, set the modules for the device and create a deployment. Creating a deployment for the device starts the modules on the device, including the IoT Edge Hub module.

When you create a new IoT Edge device, it shows the status code `417 -- The device's deployment configuration is not set` in the Azure portal. This status is normal and means the device is ready to receive a module deployment.

## Next steps

The device provisioning service enrollment process lets you set the device ID and device twin tags when you provision a new device. Use those values to target individual devices or groups of devices with automatic device management.
