# Create and provision an IoT Edge device on Linux using symmetric keys

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-all-supported](includes/iot-edge-version-all-supported.md)]

This article provides end-to-end instructions for registering and provisioning a Linux IoT Edge device that includes installing IoT Edge.

Each device that connects to an [IoT hub](../iot-hub/index.yml) has a device ID that's used to track [cloud-to-device](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-c2d-guidance.md) or [device-to-cloud](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-d2c-guidance.md) communications. You configure a device with its connection information, which includes:

* IoT hub hostname
* Device ID
* Authentication details to connect to IoT Hub

The steps in this article walk through a process called *manual provisioning*, where you connect a single device to its IoT hub. For manual provisioning, you have two options for authenticating IoT Edge devices:

* **Symmetric keys**: When you create a new device identity in IoT Hub, the service creates two keys. You place one of the keys on the device, and it presents the key to IoT Hub when authenticating.

  This authentication method is faster to get started, but not as secure.

* **X.509 self-signed**: You create two X.509 identity certificates and place them on the device. When you create a new device identity in IoT Hub, you provide thumbprints from both certificates. When the device authenticates to IoT Hub, it presents one certificate and IoT Hub verifies that the certificate matches its thumbprint.

  This authentication method is more secure and recommended for production scenarios.

This article covers using symmetric keys as your authentication method. If you want to use X.509 certificates, see [Create and provision an IoT Edge device on Linux using X.509 certificates](how-to-provision-single-device-linux-x509.md).

## Provision the device with its cloud identity

Now that the container engine and the IoT Edge runtime are installed on your device, you're ready to set up the device with its cloud identity and authentication information.

# [Ubuntu / Debian / RHEL](#tab/ubuntu+debian+rhel)

You can configure your IoT Edge device with symmetric key authentication using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge config mp --connection-string 'PASTE_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE'
   ```

   This `iotedge config mp` command creates a configuration file on the device and enters your connection string in the configuration file.

1. Apply the configuration changes.

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge config apply
   ```

1. To view the configuration file, you can open it:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/aziot/config.toml
   ```

# [Ubuntu Core snaps](#tab/snaps)

1. Create a **config.toml** file in your home directory and configure your IoT Edge device with a symmetric key authentication for the snap.

    ```bash
    sudo nano ~/config.toml
    ```

1. You can manually provision with a connection string using the following provisioning settings:

    ```toml
    [provisioning]
    source = "manual"
    connection_string = "REPLACE_WITH_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING"
    ```

    For more information about provisioning configuration settings, see [Configure IoT Edge device settings](configure-device.md#provisioning).

1. Set the configuration for IoT Edge and the Identity Service using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo snap set azure-iot-edge raw-config="$(cat ~/config.toml)"
    ```

---

## Deploy modules

To deploy your IoT Edge modules, go to your IoT hub in the Azure portal, then:

1. Select **Devices** from the IoT Hub menu.

1. Select your device to open its page.

1. Select the **Set Modules** tab.

1. Since we want to deploy the IoT Edge default modules (edgeAgent and edgeHub), we don't need to add any modules to this pane, so select **Review + create** at the bottom.

1. You see the JSON confirmation of your modules. Select **Create** to deploy the modules.

For more information, see [Deploy a module](quickstart-linux.md#deploy-a-module).

## Verify successful configuration

Verify that the runtime was successfully installed and configured on your IoT Edge device.

> [!TIP]
> You need elevated privileges to run `iotedge` commands. Once you sign out of your machine and sign back in the first time after installing the IoT Edge runtime, your permissions are automatically updated. Until then, use `sudo` in front of the commands.

1. Check to see that the IoT Edge system service is running.

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge system status
   ```

   A successful status response shows the `aziot` services as running or ready.

1. If you need to troubleshoot the service, retrieve the service logs.

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge system logs
   ```

1. Use the `check` tool to verify configuration and connection status of the device.

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge check
   ```

   You can expect a range of responses that may include **OK** (green), **Warning** (yellow), or **Error** (red). For troubleshooting common errors, see [Solutions to common issues for Azure IoT Edge](troubleshoot-common-errors.md).

   >[!TIP]
   >Always use `sudo` to run the check tool, even after your permissions are updated. The tool needs elevated privileges to access the config file to verify configuration status.

   >[!NOTE]
   >On a newly provisioned device, you may see an error related to IoT Edge Hub:
   >
   >**Ã— production readiness: Edge Hub's storage directory is persisted on the host filesystem - Error**
   >**Could not check current state of edgeHub container**
   >
   >This error is expected on a newly provisioned device because the IoT Edge Hub module is not yet running. Be sure your IoT Edge modules were deployed in the previous steps. Deployment resolves this error.
   >
   >Alternatively, you may see a status code as `417 -- The device's deployment configuration is not set`. Once your modules are deployed, this status will change.
   >

1. When the service starts for the first time, you should only see the **edgeAgent** module running. The edgeAgent module runs by default and helps to install and start any additional modules that you deploy to your device.

   Check that your device and modules are deployed and running, by viewing your device page in the Azure portal.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-single-device-linux-symmetric/modules-deployed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of IoT Edge modules deployed and running confirmation in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-single-device-linux-symmetric/modules-deployed.png":::

   Once your modules are deployed and running, list them in your device or virtual machine with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge list
   ```

## Offline or specific version installation (optional)

The steps in this section are for scenarios not covered by the standard installation steps. This may include:

* Installing IoT Edge while offline
* Installing a release candidate version

Use the steps in this section if you want to install a [specific version of the Azure IoT Edge runtime](version-history.md) that isn't available through your package manager. The Microsoft package list only contains a limited set of recent versions and their sub-versions, so these steps are for anyone who wants to install an older version or a release candidate version.

If you are using Ubuntu snaps, you can download a snap and install it offline. For more information, see [Download snaps and install offline](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/download-snaps-and-install-offline/15713).

Using curl commands, you can target the component files directly from the IoT Edge GitHub repository.

1. Navigate to the [Azure IoT Edge releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iotedge/releases), and find the release version that you want to target.

2. Expand the **Assets** section for that version.

3. Every release should have new files for IoT Edge and the identity service. If you're going to install IoT Edge on an offline device, download these files ahead of time. Otherwise, use the following commands to update those components.

   1. Find the **aziot-identity-service** file that matches your IoT Edge device's architecture. Right-click on the file link and copy the link address.

   2. Use the copied link in the following command to install that version of the identity service:

      # [Ubuntu / Debian](#tab/ubuntu+debian)
      ```bash
      curl -L <identity service link> -o aziot-identity-service.deb && sudo apt-get install ./aziot-identity-service.deb
      ```

      # [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](#tab/rhel)
      ```bash
      curl -L <identity service link> -o aziot-identity-service.rpm && sudo yum localinstall ./aziot-identity-service.rpm
      ```

      # [Ubuntu Core snaps](#tab/snaps)
      If you are using Ubuntu snaps, you can download a snap package and install it offline. For more information, see [Download snaps and install offline](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/download-snaps-and-install-offline/15713).

      ---

   3. Find the **aziot-edge** file that matches your IoT Edge device's architecture. Right-click on the file link and copy the link address.

   4. Use the copied link in the following command to install that version of IoT Edge.

      # [Ubuntu / Debian](#tab/ubuntu+debian)
      ```bash
      curl -L <iotedge link> -o aziot-edge.deb && sudo apt-get install ./aziot-edge.deb
      ```

      # [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](#tab/rhel)
      ```bash
      curl -L <iotedge link> -o aziot-edge.rpm && sudo yum localinstall ./aziot-edge.rpm
      ```

      # [Ubuntu Core snaps](#tab/snaps)
      If you are using Ubuntu snaps, you can download a snap package and install it offline. For more information, see [Download snaps and install offline](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/download-snaps-and-install-offline/15713).

## Uninstall IoT Edge

If you want to remove the IoT Edge installation from your device, use the following commands.

Remove the IoT Edge runtime.

# [Ubuntu / Debian](#tab/ubuntu+debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge aziot-edge
```

Leave out the `--purge` flag if you plan to reinstall IoT Edge and use the same configuration information in the future. The `--purge` flag deletes all the files associated with IoT Edge, including your configuration files.

# [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](#tab/rhel)
```bash
sudo yum remove aziot-edge
```

# [Ubuntu Core snaps](#tab/snaps)

Remove the IoT Edge runtime:

```bash
sudo snap remove azure-iot-edge
```

Remove Azure Identity Service:

```bash
sudo snap remove azure-iot-identity
```

---

When the IoT Edge runtime is removed, any containers that it created are stopped but still exist on your device. View all containers to see which ones remain.

```bash
sudo docker ps -a
```

Delete the containers from your device, including the two runtime containers.

```bash
sudo docker rm -f <container ID>
```

Finally, remove the container runtime from your device.

# [Ubuntu / Debian](#tab/ubuntu+debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge moby-engine
```

# [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](#tab/rhel)

```bash
sudo yum remove moby-cli
sudo yum remove moby-engine
```

# [Ubuntu Core snaps](#tab/snaps)

```bash
sudo snap remove docker
```
