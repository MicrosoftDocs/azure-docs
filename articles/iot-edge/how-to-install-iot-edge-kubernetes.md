# How to install IoT Edge on Kubernetes

IoT Edge can be installed on Kubernetes by using [KubeVirt](https://www.cncf.io/projects/kubevirt/) technology. KubeVirt is an open source, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project that offers a Kubernetes virtualization API and runtime to define and manage virtual machines. 

## Architecture

| Note | Description |
|-|-|
|  1 | Install KubeVirt Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) into the Kubernetes cluster. Like the Kubernetes cluster, management and updates to KubeVirt components are outside the purview of IoT Edge. |
|  2️ | A KubeVirt `VirtualMachine` custom resource is used to define a Virtual Machine with required resources and base operating system. A running *instance* of this resource is created in a Kubernetes Pod using [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine) and [QEMU](https://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) technologies. If your Kubernetes node itself is a Virtual Machine, you'll need to enable Nested Virtualization to use KubeVirt.|
|  3️ | The environment inside the QEMU container is just like an OS environment. IoT Edge and its dependencies (like the Docker container engine) can be setup using standard installation instructions or a [cloud-init](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/IoT-Edge-K8s-KubeVirt-Deployment/blob/12e3192b66aa9b49157c8ee9f6b832b322659f2f/deployment/helm/templates/_helper.tpl#L31) script. |

## Sample
A functional sample for running IoT Edge on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using KubeVirt is available at [https://aka.ms/iotedge-kubevirt](https://aka.ms/iotedge-kubevirt).
