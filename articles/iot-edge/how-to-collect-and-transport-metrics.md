# Collect and transport metrics

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-all-supported](includes/iot-edge-version-all-supported.md)]

You can remotely monitor your IoT Edge fleet using Azure Monitor and built-in metrics integration. To enable this capability on your device, add the metrics-collector module to your deployment and configure it to collect and transport module metrics to Azure Monitor.

To configure monitoring on your IoT Edge device, follow the [Tutorial: Monitor IoT Edge devices](tutorial-monitor-with-workbooks.md). You learn how to add the metrics-collector module to your device. This article gives you an overview of the monitoring architecture and explains your options on configuring metrics on your device.

## Architecture

| Note | Description |
|-|-|
|  1 | All modules must emit metrics using the [Prometheus data model](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/). While [built-in metrics](how-to-access-built-in-metrics.md) enable broad workload visibility by default, custom modules can also be used to emit scenario-specific metrics to enhance the monitoring solution. Learn how to instrument custom modules using open-source libraries in the [Add custom metrics](how-to-add-custom-metrics.md) article. |
|  2️ | The [metrics-collector module](https://aka.ms/edgemon-metrics-collector) is a Microsoft-supplied IoT Edge module that collects workload module metrics and transports them off-device. Metrics collection uses a *pull* model. Collection frequency, endpoints, and filters can be configured to control the data egressed from the module. For more information, see [metrics collector configuration section](#metrics-collector-configuration) later in this article. |
|  3️ | You have two options for sending metrics from the metrics-collector module to the cloud. *Option 1* sends the metrics to Log Analytics.<sup>1</sup> The collected metrics are ingested into the specified Log Analytics workspace using a fixed, native table called `InsightsMetrics`. This table's schema is compatible with the Prometheus metrics data model.<br><br> This option requires access to the workspace on outbound port 443.

|  4️ | Each metric entry contains the `ResourceId` that was specified as part of [module configuration](#metrics-collector-configuration).

|  5️ | *Option 2* sends the metrics to IoT Hub.<sup>1</sup> The collector module can be configured to send the collected metrics as UTF-8 encoded JSON [device-to-cloud messages](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md) via the `edgeHub` module. This option unlocks monitoring of locked-down IoT Edge devices that are allowed external access to only the  IoT Hub endpoint. It also enables monitoring of child IoT Edge devices in a nested configuration where child devices can only access their parent device. |
|  6️ | When metrics are routed via IoT Hub, a (one-time) cloud workflow needs to be set up. The workflow processes messages arriving from the metrics-collector module and sends them to the Log Analytics workspace. The workflow enables the [curated visualizations](how-to-explore-curated-visualizations.md) and [alerts](how-to-create-alerts.md) functionality even for metrics arriving via this optional path. See the [Route metrics through IoT Hub](#route-metrics) section for details on how to set up this cloud workflow. |

<sup>1</sup> Currently, using *option 1* to directly transport metrics to Log Analytics from the IoT Edge device is the simpler path that requires minimal setup. The first option is preferred unless your specific scenario demands the *option 2* approach so that the IoT Edge device communicates only with IoT Hub.

## Metrics collector module

A Microsoft-supplied metrics-collector module can be added to an IoT Edge deployment to collect module metrics and send them to Azure Monitor. The module code is open-source and available in the [IoT Edge GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/tree/main/edge-modules/metrics-collector).

The metrics-collector module is provided as a multi-arch Docker container image that supports Linux X64, ARM32, ARM64, and Windows X64 (version 1809). It's publicly available at [`mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-metrics-collector`](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/azureiotedge-metrics-collector/tags).

## Metrics collector configuration

All configuration for the metrics-collector is done using environment variables. Minimally, the variables noted in this table marked as **Required** need to be specified.

### Resource ID

# [IoT Hub](#tab/iothub)

The metrics-collector module requires the Azure Resource Manager ID of the IoT hub that the IoT Edge device belongs to. Provide this ID as the value of the **ResourceID** environment variable.

The resource ID takes the following format:

```input
/subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Devices/IoTHubs/<iot hub name>
```

You can find the resource ID in the **Properties** page of the IoT hub in the Azure portal.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-collect-and-transport-metrics/hub-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot the shows how to retrieve your resource ID from the IoT Hub properties." lightbox="./media/how-to-collect-and-transport-metrics/hub-id.png":::

Or, you retrieve the ID with the [az resource show](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-show) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az resource show -g <resource group> -n <hub name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Devices/IoTHubs"
```

# [IoT Central](#tab/iotcentral)

The metrics-collector module requires the Azure Resource Manager ID of the IoT Central application that the IoT Edge device belongs to. Provide this ID as the value of the **ResourceID** environment variable.

The resource ID takes the following format:

```input
/subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.IoTCentral/IoTApps/<iot central app name>
```

You can find the resource ID in the **Properties** page of the IoT Central application in the Azure portal.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-collect-and-transport-metrics/resource-id-iot-central.png" alt-text="Retrieve resource ID from the IoT Central properties.":::

Or, you retrieve the ID with the [az resource show](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-show) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az resource show -g <resource group> -n <application name> --resource-type "Microsoft.IoTCentral/IoTApps"
```

---

### Upload target

# [IoT Hub](#tab/iothub)

The **UploadTarget** configuration option controls whether metrics are sent directly to Azure Monitor or to IoT Hub.

If you set **UploadTarget** to **IoTMessage**, then your module metrics are published as IoT messages. These messages are emitted as UTF8-encoded json from the endpoint `/messages/modules/<metrics collector module name>/outputs/metricOutput`. For example, if your IoT Edge Metrics Collector module is named **IoTEdgeMetricsCollector**, the endpoint is `/messages/modules/IoTEdgeMetricsCollector/outputs/metricOutput`. The format is as follows:

```json
[{
    "TimeGeneratedUtc": "<time generated>",
    "Name": "<prometheus metric name>",
    "Value": <decimal value>,
    "Label": {
        "<label name>": "<label value>"
    }
}, {
    "TimeGeneratedUtc": "2020-07-28T20:00:43.2770247Z",
    "Name": "docker_container_disk_write_bytes",
    "Value": 0.0,
    "Label": {
        "name": "AzureMonitorForIotEdgeModule"
    }
}]
```

# [IoT Central](#tab/iotcentral)

The **UploadTarget** configuration option controls whether metrics are sent directly to Azure Monitor or to IoT Central.

If you set **UploadTarget** to **IoTMessage**, then your module metrics are published as IoT messages. These messages are emitted as UTF8-encoded json from the endpoint `/messages/modules/<metrics collector module name>/outputs/metricOutput`. For example, if your IoT Edge Metrics Collector module is named **IoTEdgeMetricsCollector**, the endpoint is `/messages/modules/IoTEdgeMetricsCollector/outputs/metricOutput`. The format is as follows:

```json
[{
    "TimeGeneratedUtc": "<time generated>",
    "Name": "<prometheus metric name>",
    "Value": <decimal value>,
    "Label": {
        "<label name>": "<label value>"
    }
}, {
    "TimeGeneratedUtc": "2020-07-28T20:00:43.2770247Z",
    "Name": "docker_container_disk_write_bytes",
    "Value": 0.0,
    "Label": {
        "name": "AzureMonitorForIotEdgeModule"
    }
}]
```

---

### Allow and disallow lists

The `AllowedMetrics` and `BlockedMetrics` configuration options take space- or comma-separated lists of metric selectors. A metric matches the list and is included or excluded if it matches one or more metrics in either list.

Metric selectors use a format similar to a subset of the [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) query language.

```query
metricToSelect{quantile=0.5,otherLabel=~Re[ge]*|x}[http://VeryNoisyModule:9001/metrics]
```

Metric selectors consist of three parts:

Metric name (`metricToSelect`).

* Wildcards `*` (any characters) and `?` (any single character) can be used in metric names. For example, `*CPU` would match `maxCPU` and `minCPU` but not `CPUMaximum`. `???CPU` would match `maxCPU` and `minCPU` but not `maximumCPU`.
* This component is required in a metrics selector.

Label-based selectors (`{quantile=0.5,otherLabel=~Re[ge]*|x}`).

* Multiple metric values can be included in the curly brackets. The values should be comma-separated.
* A metric is matched if at least all labels in the selector are present and also match.
* Like PromQL, the following matching operators are allowed.
  * `=` Match labels exactly equal to the provided string (case sensitive).
  * `!=` Match labels not exactly equal to the provided string.
  * `=~` Match labels to a provided regex. ex: `label=~CPU|Mem|[0-9]*`
  * `!~` Match labels that don't fit a provided regex.
  * Regex is fully anchored (A `^` and `$` are automatically added to the start and end of each regex)
  * This component is optional in a metrics selector.

Endpoint selector (`[http://VeryNoisyModule:9001/metrics]`).

* The URL should exactly match a URL listed in `MetricsEndpointsCSV`.
* This component is optional in a metrics selector.

A metric must match all parts of a given selector to be selected. It must match the name *and* have all the same labels with matching values *and* come from the given endpoint. For example, `mem{quantile=0.5,otherLabel=foobar}[http://VeryNoisyModule:9001/metrics]` wouldn't match the selector `mem{quantile=0.5,otherLabel=~foo|bar}[http://VeryNoisyModule:9001/metrics]`. Multiple selectors should be used to create or-like behavior instead of and-like behavior.

For example, to allow the custom metric `mem` with any label from a module `module1` but only allow the same metric from `module2` with the label `agg=p99`, the following selector can be added to `AllowedMetrics`:

```query
mem{}[http://module1:9001/metrics] mem{agg="p99"}[http://module2:9001/metrics]
```

Or, to allow the custom metrics `mem` and `cpu` for any labels or endpoint, add the following to `AllowedMetrics`:

```query
mem cpu
```

## Enable in restricted network access scenarios

If you're sending metrics directly to the Log Analytics workspace, allow outbound access to the following URLs:

* `https://<LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID>.ods.opinsights.azure.com/*`
* `https://<LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID>.oms.opinsights.azure.com/*`

### Proxy considerations

The metrics-collector module is written in .NET Core. So use the same guidance as for system modules to [allow communication through a proxy server](how-to-configure-proxy-support.md#configure-deployment-manifests).

Metrics collection from local modules uses http protocol. Exclude local communication from going through the proxy server by setting the `NO_PROXY` environment variable.

Set `NO_PROXY` value to a comma-separated list of hostnames that should be excluded. Use module names for hostnames. For example: *edgeHub,edgeAgent,myCustomModule*.

## Route metrics

# [IoT Hub](#tab/iothub)

Sometimes it's necessary to ingest metrics through IoT Hub instead of sending them directly to Log Analytics. For example, when monitoring [IoT Edge devices in a nested configuration](tutorial-nested-iot-edge.md) where child devices have access only to the IoT Edge hub of their parent device. Another example is when deploying an IoT Edge device with *outbound network access only* to IoT Hub.

To enable monitoring in this scenario, the metrics-collector module can be configured to send metrics as device-to-cloud (D2C) messages via the edgeHub module. The capability can be turned on by setting the `UploadTarget` environment variable to `IoTMessage` in the collector [configuration](#metrics-collector-configuration).

>[!TIP]
>Remember to add an edgeHub route to deliver metrics messages from the collector module to IoT Hub. It looks like `FROM /messages/modules/replace-with-collector-module-name/* INTO $upstream`.

This option does require extra setup, a cloud workflow, to deliver metrics messages arriving at IoT Hub to the Log Analytics workspace. Without this set up, the other portions of the integration such as [curated visualizations](how-to-explore-curated-visualizations.md) and [alerts](how-to-create-alerts.md) don't work.

>[!NOTE]
>Be aware of additional costs with this option. Metrics messages will count against your IoT Hub message quota. You will also be charged for Log Analytics ingestion and cloud workflow resources.

### Sample cloud workflow

A cloud workflow that delivers metrics messages from IoT Hub to Log Analytics is available as part of the [IoT Edge logging and monitoring sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iotedge-logging-and-monitoring-solution/blob/main/docs/CloudWorkflow.md). The sample can be deployed on to existing cloud resources or serve as a production deployment reference.

# [IoT Central](#tab/iotcentral)

Sometimes it's necessary to ingest metrics through IoT Central instead of sending them directly to Log Analytics. For example, when monitoring [IoT Edge devices in a nested configuration](tutorial-nested-iot-edge.md) where child devices have access only to the IoT Edge hub of their parent device. Another example is when deploying an IoT Edge device with *outbound network access only* to IoT Central.

To enable monitoring in this scenario, the metrics-collector module can be configured to send metrics as device-to-cloud (D2C) messages via the edgeHub module. The capability can be turned on by setting the `UploadTarget` environment variable to `IoTMessage` in the collector [configuration](#metrics-collector-configuration).

The following example deployment manifest shows the configuration:

>[!TIP]
>Remember to add an edgeHub route to deliver metrics messages from the collector module to IoT Central. It looks like `FROM /messages/modules/replace-with-collector-module-name/* INTO $upstream`.

To view the metrics from your IoT Edge device in your IoT Central application:

* Add the **IoT Edge Metrics standard interface** as an inherited interface to your [device template](../iot-central/core/concepts-device-templates.md):

* Use the telemetry values defined in the interface to build any [dashboards](../iot-central/core/howto-manage-dashboards.md) you need to monitor your IoT Edge devices:

>[!NOTE]
>Be aware of additional costs with this option. Metrics messages will count against your IoT Central message quota.
