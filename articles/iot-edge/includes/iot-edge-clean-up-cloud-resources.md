### Delete Azure resources 

Deleting Azure resources and resource groups is irreversible. Make sure that you don't accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. If you created the IoT hub inside an existing resource group that has resources that you want to keep, delete only the IoT hub resource itself, not the resource group.

To delete the resources:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then select **Resource groups**.

2. Select the name of the resource group that contains your IoT Edge test resources. 

3. Review the list of resources that are contained in your resource group. If you want to delete all of them, you can select **Delete resource group**. If you want to delete only some of them, you can click into each resource to delete them individually.
