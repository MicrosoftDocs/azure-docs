# Azure IoT Edge versions and release notes

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-all-supported](includes/iot-edge-version-all-supported.md)]

Azure IoT Edge is a product built from the open-source IoT Edge project hosted on GitHub. All new releases are made available in the [Azure IoT Edge project](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iotedge). Contributions and bug reports can be made on the [open-source IoT Edge project](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge).

Azure IoT Edge is governed by Microsoft's [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/products/azure-iot-edge).

## Documented versions

The IoT Edge documentation on this site is available for two different versions of the product. Currently, the two supported versions are:

* **IoT Edge 1.5 (LTS)** is the latest long-term support (LTS) version of IoT Edge and contains content for new features and capabilities that are in the latest stable release. The documentation for this version covers all features and capabilities from all previous versions through 1.5.
* **IoT Edge 1.4 (LTS)** is the previous long-term support (LTS) version of IoT Edge and is supported until November 12, 2024. This version of the documentation also contains content for the IoT Edge for Linux on Windows (EFLOW). The documentation for this version is included with IoT Edge 1.5.

**IoT Edge 1.1 (LTS)** is the first long-term support (LTS) version of IoT Edge. It's no longer supported. The [documentation is archived](/previous-versions/azure/iot-edge).

For more information about IoT Edge releases, see [Azure IoT Edge supported systems](support.md).

### IoT Edge for Linux on Windows 
Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows (EFLOW) supports the following versions:
* **EFLOW Continuous Release (CR)** based on the latest non-LTS Azure IoT Edge version, it contains new features and capabilities that are in the latest stable release. For more information, see the [EFLOW release notes](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge-eflow/releases).

* **EFLOW 1.4 (LTS)** based on Azure IoT Edge 1.4. It's the previous long-term support version. This version will be stable through the supported lifetime of this version and won't include new features released in later versions. This version is supported until Nov 2024 to match the IoT Edge 1.4 LTS release lifecycle.
