# Manage IoT Edge certificates

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-all-supported](includes/iot-edge-version-all-supported.md)]

All IoT Edge devices use certificates to create secure connections between the runtime and any modules running on the device. IoT Edge devices functioning as gateways use these same certificates to connect to their downstream devices, too. 

> [!NOTE]
> The term *root CA* used throughout this article refers to the topmost authority's certificate in the certificate chain for your IoT solution. You don't need to use the certificate root of a syndicated certificate authority, or the root of your organization's certificate authority. Often, it's actually an intermediate CA certificate.

## Prerequisites

* You should be familiar with the concepts in [Understand how Azure IoT Edge uses certificates](iot-edge-certs.md), in particular how IoT Edge uses certificates.

* An IoT Edge device.
  
  If you don't have an IoT Edge device set up, you can create one in an Azure virtual machine. Follow the steps in one of these quickstart articles to [Create a virtual Linux device](quickstart-linux.md) or [Create a virtual Windows device](quickstart.md).

* Ability to edit the IoT Edge configuration file `config.toml` following the [configuration template](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/main/edgelet/contrib/config/linux/template.toml).

* If your `config.toml` isn't based on the template, open the [template](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/main/edgelet/contrib/config/linux/template.toml) and use the commented guidance to add configuration sections following the structure of the template.

* If you have a new IoT Edge installation that hasn't been configured, copy the template to initialize the configuration. Don't use this command if you have an existing configuration. It overwrites the file.

    ```bash
    sudo cp /etc/aziot/config.toml.edge.template /etc/aziot/config.toml
    ```

## Format requirements

> [!TIP]
>
> * A certificate can be encoded in a binary representation called DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), or a textual representation called PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). The PEM format has a `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` header followed by the base64-encoded DER followed by an `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` footer.
> * Similar to the certificate, the private key can be encoded in binary DER or textual representation PEM.
> * Because PEM is delineated, it's also possible to construct a PEM that combines both the `CERTIFICATE` and `PRIVATE KEY` sequentially in the same file.
> * Lastly, the certificate and private key can be encoded together in a binary representation called *PKCS#12*, that's encrypted with an optional password.
>
> File extensions are arbitrary and you need to run the `file` command or view the file verify the type. In general, files use the following extension conventions:
>
> * `.cer` is a certificate in DER or PEM form.
> * `.pem` is either a certificate, private key, or both in PEM form.
> * `.pfx` is a *PKCS#12* file.

IoT Edge requires the certificate and private key to be:

* PEM format
* Separate files
* In most cases, with the full chain

If you get a `.pfx` file from your PKI provider, it's likely the certificate and private key encoded together in one file. Verify it's a PKCS#12 file type by using the `file` command. You can convert a PKCS#12 `.pfx` file to PEM files using the [openssl pkcs12 command](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/pkcs12.html).

If your PKI provider provides a `.cer` file, it may contain the same certificate as the `.pfx`, or it might be the PKI provider's issuing (root) certificate. To verify, inspect the file with the `openssl x509` command. If it's the issuing certificate:

* If it's in DER (binary) format, convert it to PEM with `openssl x509 -in cert.cer -out cert.pem`.
* Use the PEM file as the trust bundle. For more information about the trust bundle, see the next section.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your PKI infrastructure should support RSA-2048 bit keys and EC P-256 keys. For example, your EST servers should support these key types. You can use other key types, but we only test RSA-2048 bit keys and EC P-256 keys.

## Permission requirements

The following table lists the file and directory permissions required for the IoT Edge certificates. The preferred directory for the certificates is `/var/aziot/certs/` and `/var/aziot/secrets/` for keys.

| File or directory | Permissions | Owner |
|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| `/var/aziot/certs/` certificates directory | drwxr-xr-x (755) | aziotcs |
| Certificate files in `/var/aziot/certs/` | -rw-r--r-- (644) | aziotcs |
| `/var/aziot/secrets/` keys directory | drwx------ (700)| aziotks |
| Key files in `/var/aziot/secrets/` | -rw------- (600) | aziotks |

To create the directories, set the permissions, and set the owner, run the following commands:

```bash
# If the certificate and keys directories don't exist, create, set ownership, and set permissions
sudo mkdir -p /var/aziot/certs
sudo chown aziotcs:aziotcs /var/aziot/certs
sudo chmod 755 /var/aziot/certs

sudo mkdir -p /var/aziot/secrets
sudo chown aziotks:aziotks /var/aziot/secrets
sudo chmod 700 /var/aziot/secrets

# Give aziotcs ownership to certificates
# Read and write for aziotcs, read-only for others
sudo chown -R aziotcs:aziotcs /var/aziot/certs
sudo find /var/aziot/certs -type f -name "*.*" -exec chmod 644 {} \;

# Give aziotks ownership to private keys
# Read and write for aziotks, no permission for others
sudo chown -R aziotks:aziotks /var/aziot/secrets
sudo find /var/aziot/secrets -type f -name "*.*" -exec chmod 600 {} \;

# Verify permissions of directories and files
sudo ls -Rla /var/aziot
```

The output of the list with the correct ownership and permission is similar to the following output:

```Output
azureUser@vm:/var/aziot$ sudo ls -Rla /var/aziot
/var/aziot:
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  4 root    root    4096 Dec 14 00:16 .
drwxr-xr-x 15 root    root    4096 Dec 14 00:15 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 aziotcs aziotcs 4096 Jan 14 00:31 certs
drwx------  2 aziotks aziotks 4096 Jan 23 17:23 secrets

/var/aziot/certs:
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 2 aziotcs aziotcs 4096 Jan 14 00:31 .

-rw-r--r-- 1 aziotcs aziotcs 5887 Jan 14 00:27 iot-edge-device-ca-devicename-full-chain.cert.pem

/var/aziot/secrets:
total 16
drwx------ 2 aziotks aziotks 4096 Jan 23 17:23 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root    root    4096 Dec 14 00:16 ..
-rw------- 1 aziotks aziotks 3243 Jan 14 00:28 iot-edge-device-ca-devicename.key.pem
```

## Manage trusted root CA (trust bundle)

Using a self-signed certificate authority (CA) certificate as a root of trust with IoT Edge and modules is known as *trust bundle*. The trust bundle is available for IoT Edge and modules to communicate with servers. To configure the trust bundle, specify its file path in the IoT Edge configuration file.

1. Get the root CA certificate from a PKI provider.

1. Check that the certificate meets the [format requirements](#format-requirements).

1. Copy the PEM file and give IoT Edge's certificate service access. For example, with `/var/aziot/certs` directory:

   ```bash
   # Make the directory if doesn't exist
   sudo mkdir /var/aziot/certs -p

   # Change cert directory user and group ownership to aziotcs and set permissions
   sudo chown aziotcs:aziotcs /var/aziot/certs
   sudo chmod 755 /var/aziot/certs
   
   # Copy certificate into certs directory
   sudo cp root-ca.pem /var/aziot/certs

   # Give aziotcs ownership to certificate and set read and write permission for aziotcs, read-only for others
   sudo chown aziotcs:aziotcs /var/aziot/certs/root-ca.pem
   sudo chmod 644 /var/aziot/certs/root-ca.pem
   ```

1. In the IoT Edge configuration file `config.toml`, find the **Trust bundle cert** section. If the section is missing, you can copy it from the configuration template file.

   >[!TIP]
   >If the config file doesn't exist on your device yet, then use `/etc/aziot/config.toml.edge.template` as a template to create one.

1. Set the `trust_bundle_cert` key to the certificate file location.

   ```toml
   trust_bundle_cert = "file:///var/aziot/certs/root-ca.pem"
   ```

1. Apply the configuration.

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge config apply
   ```
### Install root CA to OS certificate store

Installing the certificate to the trust bundle file makes it available to container modules but not to host modules like Azure Device Update or Defender. If you use host level components or run into other TLS issues, also install the root CA certificate to the operating system certificate store:

# [Debian / Ubuntu](#tab/ubuntu)

  ```bash
  sudo cp /var/aziot/certs/my-root-ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/my-root-ca.pem.crt

  sudo update-ca-certificates
  ```

# [EFLOW / RHEL](#tab/windows)

  ```bash
  sudo cp /var/aziot/certs/my-root-ca.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/my-root-ca.pem.crt

  sudo update-ca-trust
  ```

---

## Import certificate and private key files

IoT Edge can use existing certificates and private key files to authenticate or attest to Azure, issue new module server certificates, and authenticate to EST servers. To install them:

1. Check the certificate and private key files meet the [format requirements](#format-requirements).

1. Copy the PEM file to the IoT Edge device where IoT Edge modules can have access. For example, the  `/var/aziot/` directory.

   ```bash
   # If the certificate and keys directories don't exist, create, set ownership, and set permissions
   sudo mkdir -p /var/aziot/certs
   sudo chown aziotcs:aziotcs /var/aziot/certs
   sudo chmod 755 /var/aziot/certs

   sudo mkdir -p /var/aziot/secrets
   sudo chown aziotks:aziotks /var/aziot/secrets
   sudo chmod 700 /var/aziot/secrets

   # Copy certificate and private key into the correct directory
   sudo cp my-cert.pem /var/aziot/certs
   sudo cp my-private-key.pem /var/aziot/secrets
   ```

1. Grant ownership to IoT Edge's certificate service `aziotcs` and key service `aziotks` to the certificate and private key, respectively.

   ```bash
   # Give aziotcs ownership to certificate
   # Read and write for aziotcs, read-only for others
   sudo chown aziotcs:aziotcs /var/aziot/certs/my-cert.pem
   sudo chmod 644 /var/aziot/certs/my-cert.pem

   # Give aziotks ownership to private key
   # Read and write for aziotks, no permission for others
   sudo chown aziotks:aziotks /var/aziot/secrets/my-private-key.pem
   sudo chmod 600 /var/aziot/secrets/my-private-key.pem
   ```

1. In `config.toml`, find the relevant section for the type of the certificate to configure. For example, you can search for the keyword `cert`.

1. Using the example from the configuration template, configure the device identity certificate or Edge CA files. The example pattern is:

    ```toml
    cert = "file:///var/aziot/certs/my-cert.pem"
    pk = "file:///var/aziot/secrets/my-private-key.pem"
    ```

1. Apply the configuration

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge config apply
   ```

To prevent errors when certificates expire, remember to manually update the files and configuration before certificate expiration.

### Example: Use device identity certificate files from PKI provider

Request a TLS client certificate and a private key from your PKI provider.

Device identity certificate requirements:

- Standard client certificate extensions:
    extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth
    keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature
- Key identifiers to help distinguish between issuing CAs with the same CN for CA certificate rotation.
    - subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
    - authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always

Ensure that the common name (CN) matches the IoT Edge device ID registered with IoT Hub or registration ID with DPS. For example, in the following device identity certificate, `Subject: CN = my-device` is the important field that must match.

Example device identity certificate:

```output
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 48 (0x30)

> [!TIP]
> To test without access to certificate files provided by a PKI, see [Create demo certificates to test device features](./how-to-create-test-certificates.md) to generate a short-lived non-production device identity certificate and private key.

Configuration example when provisioning with IoT Hub:

```toml
[provisioning]
source = "manual"
# ...
[provisioning.authentication]
method = "x509"

identity_cert = "file:///var/aziot/device-id.pem"
identity_pk = "file:///var/aziot/device-id.key.pem"
```

Configuration example when provisioning with DPS:

```toml
[provisioning]
source = "dps"
# ...
[provisioning.attestation]
method = "x509"
registration_id = "my-device"

identity_cert = "file:///var/aziot/device-id.pem"
identity_pk = "file:///var/aziot/device-id.key.pem"
```

Overhead with manual certificate management can be risky and error-prone. For production, using IoT Edge with automatic certificate management is recommended.

## Manage Edge CA

Edge CA has two different modes:

* *Quickstart* is the default behavior. Quickstart is for testing and **not** suitable for production.
* *Production* mode requires you provide your own source for Edge CA certificate and private key.

### Quickstart Edge CA

To help with getting started, IoT Edge automatically generates an **Edge CA certificate** when started for the first time by default. This self-signed certificate is only meant for development and testing scenarios, not production. By default, the certificate expires after 90 days. Expiration can be configured. This behavior is referred to as *quickstart Edge CA*.

*Quickstart Edge CA* enables `edgeHub` and other IoT Edge modules to have a valid server certificate when IoT Edge is first installed with no configuration. The certificate is needed by `edgeHub` because modules or downstream devices [need to establish secure communication channels](iot-edge-certs.md#device-verifies-gateway-identity). Without the quickstart Edge CA, getting started would be significantly harder because you'd need to provide a valid server certificate from a PKI provider or with tools like `openssl`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never use the quickstart Edge CA for production because the locally generated certificate in it isn't connected to a PKI.
>
> The security of a certificates-based identity derives from a well-operated PKI (the infrastructure) in which the certificate (a document) is only a component. A well-operated PKI enables definition, application, management, and enforcements of security policies to include but not limited to certificates issuance, revocation, and lifecycle management.

#### Customize lifetime for quickstart Edge CA

To configure the certificate expiration to something other than the default 90 days, add the value in days to the **Edge CA certificate (Quickstart)** section of the config file.

```toml
[edge_ca]
auto_generated_edge_ca_expiry_days = 180
```

Delete the contents of the `/var/lib/aziot/certd/certs` and `/var/lib/aziot/keyd/keys` folders to remove any previously generated certificates then apply the configuration.

#### Renew quickstart Edge CA

By default, IoT Edge automatically renews the quickstart Edge CA certificate when at 80% of the certificate lifetime. For example, if a certificate has a 90 day lifetime, IoT Edge automatically regenerates the Edge CA certificate at 72 days from issuance.

To change the auto-renewal logic, add the following settings to the *Edge CA certificate* section in `config.toml`. For example:

```toml
[edge_ca.auto_renew]
rotate_key = true
threshold = "70%"
retry = "2%"
```

### Edge CA in production

Once you move into a production scenario, or you want to create a gateway device, you can no longer use the quickstart Edge CA.

One option is to provide your own certificates and manage them manually. However, to avoid the risky and error-prone manual certificate management process, use an EST server whenever possible.

> [!CAUTION]
> The common name (CN) of Edge CA certificate can't match device hostname parameter defined in the device's configuration file *config.toml* or the device ID registered in IoT Hub.

### Plan for Edge CA renewal

When the Edge CA certificate renews, all the certificates it issued like module server certificates are regenerated. To give the modules new server certificates, IoT Edge restarts all modules when Edge CA certificate renews.

To minimize potential negative effects of module restarts, plan to renew the Edge CA certificate at a specific time (for example, `threshold = "10d"`) and notify dependents of the solution about the downtime.

### Example: use Edge CA certificate files from PKI provider

Request the following files from your PKI provider:

* The PKI's root CA certificate
* An issuing/CA certificate and associated private key

For the issuing CA certificate to become Edge CA, it must have these extensions:

```text
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always
basicConstraints = critical, CA:TRUE, pathlen:0
keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyCertSign
```

Example of the result Edge CA certificate:

```bash
openssl x509 -in my-edge-ca-cert.pem -text
```

```output
Certificate:

Once you receive the latest files, [update the trust bundle](#manage-trusted-root-ca-trust-bundle):

```toml
trust_bundle_cert = "file:///var/aziot/root-ca.pem"
```

Then, configure IoT Edge to use the certificate and private key files:

```toml
[edge_ca]
cert = "file:///var/aziot/my-edge-ca-cert.pem"
pk = "file:///var/aziot/my-edge-ca-private-key.key.pem"
```

If you've used any other certificates for IoT Edge on the device before, delete the files in `/var/lib/aziot/certd/certs` and the private keys associated with certificates (*not* all keys) in `/var/lib/aziot/keyd/keys`. IoT Edge recreates them with the new CA certificate you provided.

This approach requires you to manually update the files as certificate expires. To avoid this issue, consider using EST for automatic management.

## Automatic certificate management with EST server

IoT Edge can interface with an [Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) server](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrollment_over_Secure_Transport) for automatic certificate issuance and renewal. Using EST is recommended for production as it replaces the need for manual certificate management, which can be risky and error-prone. It can be configured globally and overridden for each certificate type.

In this scenario, the bootstrap certificate and private key are expected to be long-lived and potentially installed on the device during manufacturing. IoT Edge uses the bootstrap credentials to authenticate to the EST server for the initial request to issue an identity certificate for subsequent requests and for authentication to DPS or IoT Hub.

1. Get access to an EST server. If you don't have an EST server, use one of the following options to start testing:

   * Create a test EST server using the steps in [Tutorial: Configure Enrollment over Secure Transport Server for Azure IoT Edge](tutorial-configure-est-server.md).

   * Microsoft partners with GlobalSign to [provide a demo account](https://www.globalsign.com/lp/globalsign-and-microsoft-azure-iot-edge-enroll-demo).

1. In the IoT Edge device configuration file `config.toml`, configure the path to a trusted root certificate that IoT Edge uses to validate the EST server's TLS certificate. This step is optional if the EST server has a publicly trusted root TLS certificate.

   ```toml
   [cert_issuance.est]
   trusted_certs = [
      "file:///var/aziot/root-ca.pem",
   ]
   ```

1. Provide a default URL for the EST server. In `config.toml`, add the following section with the URL of the EST server:

   ```toml
   [cert_issuance.est.urls]
   default = "https://example.org/.well-known/est"
   ```

1. To configure the EST certificate for authentication, add the following section with the path to the certificate and private key:

   ```toml
   [cert_issuance.est.auth]
   bootstrap_identity_cert = "file:///var/aziot/my-est-id-bootstrap-cert.pem"
   bootstrap_identity_pk = "file:///var/aziot/my-est-id-bootstrap-pk.key.pem"

   [cert_issuance.est.identity_auto_renew]
   rotate_key = true
   threshold = "80%"
   retry = "4%"
   ```

1. Apply the configuration changes.

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge config apply
   ```

The settings in `[cert_issuance.est.identity_auto_renew]` are covered in the next section.

### Username and password authentication

If authentication to EST server using certificate isn't possible, you can use a shared secret or username and password instead.

```toml
[cert_issuance.est.auth]
username = "username"
password = "password"
```

### Configure auto-renew parameters

Instead of manually managing the certificate files, IoT Edge has the built-in ability to get and renew certificates before expiry. Certificate renewal requires an issuance method that IoT Edge can manage. Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) server is one issuance method, but IoT Edge can also automatically [renew the quickstart CA by default](#renew-quickstart-edge-ca). Certificate renewal is configured per type of certificate.

1. In `config.toml`, find the relevant section for the type of the certificate to configure. For example, you can search for the keyword `auto_renew`.

1. Using the example from the configuration template, configure the device identity certificate, Edge CA, or EST identity certificates. The example pattern is:

   ```toml
   [REPLACE_WITH_CERT_TYPE]
   # ...
   method = "est"
   # ...

   [REPLACE_WITH_CERT_TYPE.auto_renew]
   rotate_key = true
   threshold = "80%" 
   retry = "4%"
   ```

1. Apply the configuration

   ```bash
   sudo iotege config apply
   ```

The following table lists what each option in `auto_renew` does:

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|---------|
|`rotate_key`| Controls if the private key should be rotated when IoT Edge renews the certificate.|
|`threshold`| Sets when IoT Edge should start renewing the certificate. It can be specified as: <br> - Percentage: integer between `0` and `100` followed by `%`. Renewal starts relative to the certificate lifetime. For example, when set to `80%`, a certificate that is valid for 100 days begins renewal at 20 days before its expiry. <br> - Absolute time: integer followed by `min` (minutes) or `day` (days). Renewal starts relative to the certificate expiration time. For example, when set to `4day` for four days or `10min` for 10 minutes, the certificate begins renewing at that time before expiry. To avoid unintentional misconfiguration where the `threshold` is bigger than the certificate lifetime, we recommend using *percentage* instead whenever possible.|
|`retry`| controls how often renewal should be retried on failure. Like `threshold`, it can similarly be specified as a *percentage* or *absolute time* using the same format.|

### Example: renew device identity certificate automatically with EST

To use EST and IoT Edge for automatic device identity certificate issuance and renewal, which is recommended for production, IoT Edge must provision as part of a [DPS CA-based enrollment group](./how-to-provision-devices-at-scale-linux-x509.md?tabs=group-enrollment%2cubuntu). For example:

```toml
## DPS provisioning with X.509 certificate
[provisioning]
source = "dps"
# ...
[provisioning.attestation]
method = "x509"
registration_id = "my-device"

[provisioning.attestation.identity_cert]
method = "est"
common_name = "my-device"

[provisioning.attestation.identity_cert.auto_renew]
rotate_key = true
threshold = "80%"
retry = "4%"
```

Automatic renewal for Edge CA must be enabled when issuance method is set to EST. Edge CA expiration must be avoided as it breaks many IoT Edge functionalities. If a situation requires total control over Edge CA certificate lifecycle, use the [manual Edge CA management method](#example-use-edge-ca-certificate-files-from-pki-provider) instead.

Don't use EST or `auto_renew` with other methods of provisioning, including manual X.509 provisioning with IoT Hub and DPS with individual enrollment. IoT Edge can't update certificate thumbprints in Azure when a certificate is renewed, which prevents IoT Edge from reconnecting.

### Example: automatic Edge CA management with EST

Use EST automatic Edge CA issuance and renewal for production. Once EST server is configured, you can use the global setting, or override it similar to this example:

```toml
[edge_ca]
method = "est"

common_name = "my-edge-CA"
url = "https://ca.example.org/.well-known/est"

bootstrap_identity_cert = "file:///var/aziot/my-est-id-bootstrap-cert.pem"
bootstrap_identity_pk = "file:///var/aziot/my-est-id-bootstrap-pk.key.pem"

[edge_ca.auto_renew]
rotate_key = true
threshold = "90%"
retry = "2%"
```

## Module server certificates

Edge Daemon issues module server and identity certificates for use by Edge modules. It remains the responsibility of Edge modules to renew their identity and server certificates as needed.

### Renewal

Server certificates may be issued off the Edge CA certificate. Regardless of the issuance method, these certificates must be renewed by the module. If you develop a custom module, you must implement the renewal logic in your module.

The *edgeHub* module supports a certificate renewal feature. You can configure the *edgeHub* module server certificate renewal using the following environment variables:

* **ServerCertificateRenewAfterInMs**: Sets the duration in milliseconds when the *edgeHub* server certificate is renewed irrespective of certificate expiry time.
* **MaxCheckCertExpiryInMs**: Sets the duration in milliseconds when *edgeHub* service checks the *edgeHub* server certificate expiration. If the variable is set, the check happens irrespective of certificate expiry time.

For more information about the environment variables, see [EdgeHub and EdgeAgent environment variables](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/main/doc/EnvironmentVariables.md).

## Changes in 1.2 and later

* The **Device CA certificate** was renamed as **Edge CA certificate**.
* The **workload CA certificate** was deprecated. Now the IoT Edge security manager generates the IoT Edge hub `edgeHub` server certificate directly from the Edge CA certificate, without the intermediate workload CA certificate between them.
* The default config file has a new name and location, from `/etc/iotedge/config.yaml` to `/etc/aziot/config.toml` by default. The `iotedge config import` command can be used to help migrate configuration information from the old location and syntax to the new one.
