# Access built-in metrics in Azure IoT Edge

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-all-supported](includes/iot-edge-version-all-supported.md)]

The IoT Edge runtime components, IoT Edge hub, and IoT Edge agent, produce built-in metrics in the [Prometheus exposition format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/). Access these metrics remotely to monitor and understand the health of an IoT Edge device.

You can use your own solution to access these metrics. Or, you can use the [metrics-collector module](https://mcr.microsoft.com/artifact/mar/azureiotedge-metrics-collector), which handles collecting the built-in metrics and sending them to Azure Monitor or Azure IoT Hub. For more information, see [Collect and transport metrics](how-to-collect-and-transport-metrics.md).

Metrics are automatically exposed by default on **port 9600** of the **edgeHub** and **edgeAgent** modules (`http://edgeHub:9600/metrics` and `http://edgeAgent:9600/metrics`). They aren't port mapped to the host by default.

Access metrics from the host by exposing and mapping the metrics port from the module's `createOptions`. The example below maps the default metrics port to port 9601 on the host:

```json
{
  "ExposedPorts": {
    "9600/tcp": {}
  },
  "HostConfig": {
    "PortBindings": {
      "9600/tcp": [
        {
          "HostPort": "9601"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Choose different and unique host port numbers if you are mapping both the edgeHub and edgeAgent's metrics endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> The environment variable `httpSettings__enabled` should not be set to `false` for built-in metrics to be available for collection.
>
> Environment variables that can be used to disable metrics are listed in the [azure/iotedge repo doc](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/main/doc/EnvironmentVariables.md).

## Available metrics

Metrics contain tags to help identify the nature of the metric being collected. All metrics contain the following tags:

| Tag | Description |
|-|-|
| iothub | The hub the device is talking to |
| edge_device | The ID of the current device |
| instance_number | A GUID representing the current runtime. On restart, all metrics are reset. This GUID makes it easier to reconcile restarts. |

In the Prometheus exposition format, there are four core metric types: counter, gauge, histogram, and summary. For more information about the different metric types, see the [Prometheus metric types documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/).

The quantiles provided for the built-in histogram and summary metrics are 0.1, 0.5, 0.9 and 0.99.

The **edgeHub** module produces the following metrics:

| Name | Dimensions | Description |
