# How to buy or sign up for an Azure subscription

This topic will help you with the following tasks:

* Sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription
* Upgrade your Azure Free Trial subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription
* Activate your Azure subscription by using a Online Service Activation Key (a 5x5 key)

## Sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription
To sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription, you must provide a phone number, a credit card, and a [Microsoft Account](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/faq.aspx) (formerly Windows Live ID) or a School/Work account (aka Organizations ID). Your phone number and credit card are used only to verify your identity, and your credit card will not be billed.

>[AZURE.NOTE] We will place $1 in the United States or something similar for the currency in your region authorization hold on your payment card to make sure it is a valid card, and this will be released within 3-5 days, based on your financial institution’s policies. Your card will not be charged.

To sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription:

1. Open the [Azure free trial page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/), and then select **Try it now**.

2. Sign in to your Microsoft account or School/Work account.

3. In the **About you** section, type your personal information. Note that Country cannot be changed once it is specified. ![The screenshow of personal information](./media/billing-buy-sign-up-azure-subscription/AboutYou.png)

4. Verification by phone involves a code being sent to your phone using your preferred method: phone call or SMS. When you enter the code you receive, it helps us verify your identity. </br></br> In the **Verification by phone** section, select the international dialing code for your country, type your phone number (Do not type the internal dialing code) and then select **Send text message** or **Call me**. After you receive a verification code, enter it in the **Verify code** box, and then select the **Verify code** button to verify your phone number. </br>

>[AZURE.NOTE] A VOIP phone number cannot be used for phone verification.

If you do not receive a text message or a call back, try using a different phone number or contact [Microsoft Support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) for help.

5. After the Phone verification is completed, move to the card
 verification section.

It can take a few minutes to set up your subscription. If the subscription setup does not complete in 15 minutes contact [Microsoft Support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) for assistance. </br>
If you get any error message, follow the steps in the message to resolve the issue. A typical error message is:

**Sorry, we could not complete the operation. Please try again later or reload the web page** </br>

In this case, try using another browser to complete the sign-up process. If the issue still occurs, contact [Microsoft Support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) for help.
