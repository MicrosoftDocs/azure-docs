# Create and use shared images for virtual machine scale sets with the Azure PowerShell

When you create a scale set, you specify an image to be used when the VM instances are deployed. The Shared Image Gallery service greatly simplifies custom image sharing across your organization. Custom images are like marketplace images, but you create them yourself. Custom images can be used to bootstrap configurations such as preloading applications, application configurations, and other OS configurations. 

The Shared Image Gallery lets you share your custom VM images with others in your organization, within or across regions, within an AAD tenant. Choose which images you want to share, which regions you want to make them available in, and who you want to share them with. You can create multiple galleries so that you can logically group shared images. 

The gallery is a top-level resource that provides full role-based access control (RBAC). Images can be versioned, and you can choose to replicate each image version to a different set of Azure regions. The gallery only works with Managed Images. 

The Shared Image Gallery feature has multiple resource types. We will be using or building these in this article:

| Resource | Description|
|----------|------------|
| **Managed image** | This is a basic image that can be used alone or used to create an **image version** in an image gallery. Managed images are created from generalized VMs. A managed image is a special type of VHD that can be used to make multiple VMs and can now be used to create shared image versions. |
| **Image gallery** | Like the Azure Marketplace, an **image gallery** is a repository for managing and sharing images, but you control who has access. |
| **Image definition** | Images are defined within a gallery and carry information about the image and requirements for using it internally. This includes whether the image is Windows or Linux, release notes, and minimum and maximum memory requirements. It is a definition of a type of image. |
| **Image version** | An **image version** is what you use to create a VM when using a gallery. You can have multiple versions of an image as needed for your environment. Like a managed image, when you use an **image version** to create a VM, the image version is used to create new disks for the VM. Image versions can be used multiple times. |

If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Before you begin

The steps below detail how to take an existing VM and turn it into a reusable custom image that you can use to create new VM instances.

To complete the example in this article, you must have an existing managed image. You can follow [Tutorial: Create and use a custom image for virtual machine scale sets with Azure PowerShell](tutorial-use-custom-image-powershell.md) to create one if needed. If the managed image contains a data disk, the data disk size cannot be more than 1 TB.

When working through the article, replace the resource group and VM names where needed.

## Create a scale set from the shared image version

Create a virtual machine scale set with [New-AzVmss](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmss). The following example creates a scale set from the new image version in the *South Central US* datacenter. When prompted, set your own administrative credentials for the VM instances in the scale set:


```azurepowershell-interactive
# Define variables
$resourceGroupName = "myVMSSRG"
$scaleSetName = "myScaleSet"
$location = "South Central US"
$cred = Get-Credential

# Create a resource group
New-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Location $location

# Create a netowrking pieces
$subnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
  -Name "mySubnet" `
  -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24
$vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
  -Name "myVnet" `
  -Location $location `
  -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 `
  -Subnet $subnet
$publicIP = New-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
  -Location $location `
  -AllocationMethod Static `
  -Name "myPublicIP"
$frontendIP = New-AzLoadBalancerFrontendIpConfig `
  -Name "myFrontEndPool" `
  -PublicIpAddress $publicIP
$backendPool = New-AzLoadBalancerBackendAddressPoolConfig -Name "myBackEndPool"
$inboundNATPool = New-AzLoadBalancerInboundNatPoolConfig `
  -Name "myRDPRule" `
  -FrontendIpConfigurationId $frontendIP.Id `
  -Protocol TCP `
  -FrontendPortRangeStart 50001 `
  -FrontendPortRangeEnd 50010 `
  -BackendPort 3389
# Create the load balancer and health probe
$lb = New-AzLoadBalancer `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
  -Name "myLoadBalancer" `
  -Location $location `
  -FrontendIpConfiguration $frontendIP `
  -BackendAddressPool $backendPool `
  -InboundNatPool $inboundNATPool
Add-AzLoadBalancerProbeConfig -Name "myHealthProbe" `
  -LoadBalancer $lb `
  -Protocol TCP `
  -Port 80 `
  -IntervalInSeconds 15 `
  -ProbeCount 2
Add-AzLoadBalancerRuleConfig `
  -Name "myLoadBalancerRule" `
  -LoadBalancer $lb `
  -FrontendIpConfiguration $lb.FrontendIpConfigurations[0] `
  -BackendAddressPool $lb.BackendAddressPools[0] `
  -Protocol TCP `
  -FrontendPort 80 `
  -BackendPort 80 `
  -Probe (Get-AzLoadBalancerProbeConfig -Name "myHealthProbe" -LoadBalancer $lb)
Set-AzLoadBalancer -LoadBalancer $lb

# Create IP address configurations
$ipConfig = New-AzVmssIpConfig `
  -Name "myIPConfig" `
  -LoadBalancerBackendAddressPoolsId $lb.BackendAddressPools[0].Id `
  -LoadBalancerInboundNatPoolsId $inboundNATPool.Id `
  -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id

# Create a configuration 
$vmssConfig = New-AzVmssConfig `
    -Location $location `
    -SkuCapacity 2 `
    -SkuName "Standard_DS2" `
    -UpgradePolicyMode "Automatic"

# Reference the image version
Set-AzVmssStorageProfile $vmssConfig `
  -OsDiskCreateOption "FromImage" `
  -Id $imageVersion.Id

# Complete the configuration
Set-AzVmssOsProfile $vmssConfig `
  -AdminUsername $cred.UserName `
  -AdminPassword $cred.Password `
  -ComputerNamePrefix "myVM"
Add-AzVmssNetworkInterfaceConfiguration `
  -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmssConfig `
  -Name "network-config" `
  -Primary $true `
  -IPConfiguration $ipConfig

# Create the scale set 
New-AzVmss `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
  -Name $scaleSetName `
  -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmssConfig
```

It takes a few minutes to create and configure all the scale set resources and VMs.
