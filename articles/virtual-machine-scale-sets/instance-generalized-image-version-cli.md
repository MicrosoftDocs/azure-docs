# Create a scale set from a generalized image

Create a scale set from a generalized image version stored in a [Shared Image Gallery](shared-image-galleries.md) using the Azure CLI. If want to create a scale set using a specialized image version, see [Create scale set instances from a specialized image](instance-specialized-image-version-cli.md).

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.4.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Replace resource names as needed in this example. 

List the image definitions in a gallery using [az sig image-definition list](/cli/azure/sig/image-definition#az-sig-image-definition-list) to see the name and ID of the definitions.

```azurecli-interactive 
resourceGroup=myGalleryRG
gallery=myGallery
az sig image-definition list \
   --resource-group $resourceGroup \
   --gallery-name $gallery \
   --query "[].[name, id]" \
   --output tsv
```

Create the scale set using [`az vmss create`](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-create). 

Use the image definition ID for `--image` to create the scale set instances from the latest version of the image that is available. You can also create the scale set instances from a specific version by supplying the image version ID for `--image`. Be aware that using a specific image version means automation could fail if that specific image version isn't available because it was deleted or removed from the region. We recommend using the image definition ID for creating your new VM, unless a specific image version is required.

In this example, we are creating instances from the latest version of the *myImageDefinition* image.

```azurecli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
az vmss create \
   --resource-group myResourceGroup \
   --name myScaleSet \
   --image "/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourceGroups/myGalleryRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/images/myImageDefinition" 
   --admin-username azureuser \
   --generate-ssh-keys
```

It takes a few minutes to create and configure all the scale set resources and VMs.

## Next steps
[Azure Image Builder (preview)](../virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-overview.md) can help automate image version creation, you can even use it to update and [create a new image version from an existing image version](../virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-gallery-update-image-version.md). 

You can also create Shared Image Gallery resource using templates. There are several Azure Quickstart Templates available: 

- [Create a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-create/)
- [Create an Image Definition in a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-image-definition-create/)
- [Create an Image Version in a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-image-version-create/)

For more information about Shared Image Galleries, see the [Overview](shared-image-galleries.md). If you run into issues, see [Troubleshooting shared image galleries](troubleshooting-shared-images.md).
