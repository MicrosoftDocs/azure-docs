# Proprietary protocols

**Complete Protocol Support:** In addition to embedded protocol support, you can secure IoT and ICS devices running proprietary and custom protocols, or protocols that deviate from any standard. Using the *Horizon Open Development Environment (ODE) SDK*, developers can create dissector plugins that decode network traffic based on defined protocols. Traffic is analyzed by services to provide complete monitoring, alerting and reporting. Use Horizon to:

- **Expand** visibility and control without the need to upgrade to new versions.

- **Secure** proprietary information by developing on-site as an external plugin.

- **Localize** text for alerts, events, and protocol parameters
