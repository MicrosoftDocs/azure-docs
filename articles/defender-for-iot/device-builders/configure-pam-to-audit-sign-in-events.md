# Configure Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to audit sign-in events

This article provides a sample process for configuring Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to audit SSH, Telnet, and terminal sign-in events on an unmodified Ubuntu 20.04 or 18.04 installation.

PAM configurations may vary between devices and Linux distributions.

For more information, see [Login collector (event-based collector)](concept-event-aggregation.md#login-collector-event-based-collector).

[!INCLUDE [device-agents-note](../includes/device-agents-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure that you have a Defender for IoT Micro Agent.

Configuring PAM requires technical knowledge.

For more information, see [Tutorial: Install the Defender for IoT micro agent](tutorial-standalone-agent-binary-installation.md).

## Modify PAM configuration to report sign-in and sign-out events

This procedure provides a sample process for configuring the collection of successful sign-in events.

Our example is based on an unmodified Ubuntu 20.04 or 18.04 installation, and the steps in this process may differ for your system.

1. Locate the following files:

    - `/etc/pam.d/sshd`
    - `/etc/pam.d/login`

1. Append the following lines to the end of each file:

    ```txt
    // report login
    session [default=ignore] pam_exec.so type=open_session /usr/libexec/defender_iot_micro_agent/pam/pam_audit.sh 0

    // report logout
    session [default=ignore] pam_exec.so type=close_session /usr/libexec/defender_iot_micro_agent/pam/pam_audit.sh 1
    ```

## Modify the PAM configuration to report sign-in failures

This procedure provides a sample process for configuring the collection of failed sign-in attempts.

This example in this procedure is based on an unmodified Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 installation. The files and commands listed below may differ per configuration or as a result of modifications.

1. Locate the `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` file and look for the following lines:

    ```txt
    # here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
    auth    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so nullok_secure
    # here's the fallback if no module succeeds
    auth    requisite           pam_deny.so
    ```

    This section authenticates via the `pam_unix.so` module. In case of authentication failure, this section continues to the `pam_deny.so` module to prevent access.

1. Replace the indicated lines of code with the following:

    ```txt
    # here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
    auth	[success=1 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so nullok_secure
    auth	[success=1 default=ignore]	pam_exec.so quiet /usr/libexec/defender_iot_micro_agent/pam/pam_audit.sh 2
    auth	[success=1 default=ignore]	pam_echo.so
    # here's the fallback if no module succeeds
    auth	requisite			pam_deny.so
    ```

    In this modified section, PAM skips one module to the `pam_echo.so` module, and then skips the `pam_deny.so` module and authenticates successfully.

    In case of failure, PAM continues to report the sign-in failure to the agent log file, and then skips one module to the `pam_deny.so` module, which blocks access.

## Validate your configuration

This procedure describes how to verify that you've configured PAM correctly to audit sign-in events.

1. Sign in to the device using SSH, and then sign-out.

1. Sign in to the device using SSH, using incorrect credentials to create a failed sign-in event.

1. Access your device and run the following command:

    ```bash
    cat /var/lib/defender_iot_micro_agent/pam.log
    ```

1. Verify that lines similar to the following are logged, for a successful sign-in (`open_session`), sign-out (`close_session`), and a sign-in failure (`auth`):

    ```txt
    2021-10-31T18:10:31+02:00,16356631,2589842,open_session,sshd,user,192.168.0.101,ssh,0
    2021-10-31T18:26:19+02:00,16356719,199164,close_session,sshd, user,192.168.0.201,ssh,1
    2021-10-28T17:44:13+03:00,163543223,3572596,auth,sshd,user,143.24.20.36,ssh,2
    ```

1. Repeat the verification procedure with Telnet and terminal connections.
