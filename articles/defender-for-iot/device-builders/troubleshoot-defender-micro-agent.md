## Service status 

To view the status of the service: 

1. Run the following command

If the service is listed as `inactive`, use the following command to start the service:

```bash
systemctl start defender-iot-micro-agent.service 
```

You will know that the service is crashing if, the process uptime is less than 2 minutes. To resolve this issue, you must [review the logs](#review-the-logs).
