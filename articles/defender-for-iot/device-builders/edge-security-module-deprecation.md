# Feature support and retirement

This article describes Azure Defender for IoT features and support for different capabilities within Defender for IoT.

## Defender for IoT C, C#, and Edge Defender-IoT-micro-agent deprecation

The new micro agent will replace the current C, C#, and Edge Defender-IoT-micro-agent.  

The new micro agent development is based on the knowledge, and experience gathered from the classic security module development, customers, and feedback from partners with four important improvements:

- **Depth security value**: The new agent will run on the host level, which will provide more visibility to the underlying operations of the device, and to allow for better security coverage.

- **Improved device performance and reduced footprint**: Achieved by a small RAM, and ROM memory footprint as well as low CPU consumption.  

- **Plug and play**: The new micro agent has no kernel level dependencies anymore, and all of its software dependencies are provided as part of its package. The micro agent supports common CPU architecture.

- **Easy to deploy**: The micro agent supports different distribution models, through source code, and as a binary package. 

### Timeline 

Defender for IoT will continue to support C, C#, and Edge until March 1, 2022.
