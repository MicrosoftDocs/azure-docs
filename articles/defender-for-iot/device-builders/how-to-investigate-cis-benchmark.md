# Investigate OS baseline (based on CIS benchmark) recommendation

Perform basic and advanced investigations based on OS baseline recommendations.

## Basic OS baseline security recommendation investigation

You can investigate OS baseline recommendations by navigating to [Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started). For more information, see how to [Investigate security recommendations](quickstart-investigate-security-recommendations.md).

## Advanced OS baseline security recommendation investigation

This section describes how to better understand the OS baseline test results, and querying events in Azure Log Analytics.

**Prerequisites**:

The advanced OS baseline security recommendation investigation is only supported by using Azure Log Analytics and you must connect Defender for IoT to a Log Analytics workspace before continuing.

For more information, see [Configure Microsoft Defender for IoT agent-based solution](tutorial-configure-agent-based-solution.md).

**To query your IoT security events in Log Analytics for alerts**:

1. In your Log Analytics workspace, go to **Logs** > **AzureSecurityOfThings** > **SecurityAlert**.

1. In the query editor on the right, enter a KQL query to display the alerts you want to see. 

1. Select **Run** to display the alerts that match your query.

For example:

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to alerts, you can also use this same procedure to query for recommendations or raw event data.

## Useful queries to investigate the OS baseline resources

> [!Note]
> Make sure to replace `<device-id>` with the name(s) you gave your device in each of the following queries.

### Retrieve the latest information

- **Device fleet failure**: Run this query to retrieve the latest information about checks that failed across the device fleet:

    ```kusto
    let lastDates = SecurityIoTRawEvent |
    where RawEventName == "Baseline" |
    summarize TimeStamp=max(TimeStamp) by DeviceId;
    lastDates | join kind=inner (SecurityIoTRawEvent) on TimeStamp, DeviceId |
    extend event = parse_json(EventDetails) |
    where event.BaselineCheckResult == "FAIL" |
    project DeviceId, event.BaselineCheckId, event.BaselineCheckDescription
    ```

- **Specific device failure** - Run this query to retrieve the latest information about checks that failed on a specific device:  

    ```kusto
    let id = SecurityIoTRawEvent | 
    extend IoTRawEventId = extractjson("$.EventId", EventDetails, typeof(string)) |
    where TimeGenerated <= now() |
    where RawEventName == "Baseline" |
    where DeviceId == "<device-id>" |
    summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, IoTRawEventId) |
    project IoTRawEventId;
    SecurityIoTRawEvent |
    extend IoTRawEventId = extractjson("$.EventId", EventDetails, typeof(string)), extraDetails = todynamic(EventDetails) |
    where IoTRawEventId == toscalar(id) |
    where extraDetails.BaselineCheckResult == "FAIL" |
    project DeviceId, CceId = extraDetails.BaselineCheckId, Description = extraDetails.BaselineCheckDescription
    ```

- **Specific device error** - Run this query to retrieve the latest information about checks that have an error on a specific device:

    ```kusto
    let id = SecurityIoTRawEvent |
    extend IoTRawEventId = extractjson("$.EventId", EventDetails, typeof(string)) |
    where TimeGenerated <= now() |
    where RawEventName == "Baseline" |
    where DeviceId == "<device-id>" |
    summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, IoTRawEventId) |
    project IoTRawEventId;
    SecurityIoTRawEvent |
    extend IoTRawEventId = extractjson("$.EventId", EventDetails, typeof(string)), extraDetails = todynamic(EventDetails) |
    where IoTRawEventId == toscalar(id) |
    where extraDetails.BaselineCheckResult == "ERROR" |
    project DeviceId, CceId = extraDetails.BaselineCheckId, Description = extraDetails.BaselineCheckDescription
    ```

- **Update device list for device fleet that failed a specific check** - Run this query to retrieve updated list of devices (across the device fleet) that failed a specific check:  

    ```kusto
    let lastDates = SecurityIoTRawEvent |
    where RawEventName == "Baseline" |
    summarize TimeStamp=max(TimeStamp) by DeviceId;
    lastDates | join kind=inner (SecurityIoTRawEvent) on TimeStamp, DeviceId |
    extend event = parse_json(EventDetails) |
    where event.BaselineCheckResult == "FAIL" |
    where event.BaselineCheckId contains "6.2.8" |
    project DeviceId;
    ```
