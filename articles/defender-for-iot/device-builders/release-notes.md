### Device builder - new micro agent (Public preview)

A new device builder module is available. The module, referred to as a micro-agent, allows:

- **Integration with Azure IoT Hub and Defender for IoT** - build stronger endpoint security directly into your IoT devices by integrating it with the monitoring option provided by both the Azure IoT Hub and Defender for IoT.

- **Flexible deployment options with support for standard IoT operating systems** - can be deployed either as a binary package or as modifiable source code, with support for standard IoT operating systems like Linux and Eclipse ThreadX.

- **Minimal resource requirements with no OS kernel dependencies** - small footprint, low CPU consumption, and no OS kernel dependencies.

- **Security posture management** – proactively monitor the security posture of your IoT devices.

- **Continuous, real-time IoT/OT threat detection** - detect threats such as botnets, brute force attempts, crypto miners, and suspicious network activity

The deprecated Defender-IoT-micro-agent documentation will be moved to the *Agent-based solution for device builders>Legacy* folder.

This feature set is available with the current public preview cloud release.
