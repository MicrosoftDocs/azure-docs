# Defender-IoT-micro-agent for Eclipse ThreadX security alerts and recommendations (preview)

Defender-IoT-micro-agent for Eclipse ThreadX continuously analyzes your IoT solution using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to alert you to potential malicious activity and suspicious system modifications. You can also create custom alerts based on your knowledge of expected device behavior and baselines.

A Defender-IoT-micro-agent for Eclipse ThreadX alert acts as an indicator of potential compromise, and should be investigated and remediated. A Defender-IoT-micro-agent for Eclipse ThreadX recommendation identifies weak security posture to be remediated and updated. 

In this article, you find a list of built-in alerts and recommendations that are triggered based on the default ranges, and customizable with your own values, based on expected or baseline behavior. 

For more information on how alert customization works in the Defender for IoT service, see [customizable alerts](concept-customizable-security-alerts.md). The specific alerts and recommendations available for customization when using the Defender-IoT-micro-agent for Eclipse ThreadX are detailed in the following tables.
