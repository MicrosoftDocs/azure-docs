## Investigate security alerts

The Defender for IoT security alert list displays all of the aggregated security alerts for your IoT Hub.

**To investigate security alerts**:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to **IoT Hub** > **`Your hub`** > **Defender for IoT** > **Security Alerts**.

1. Select an alert from the list to open the alert's details.

## Investigate security alert details

Opening each aggregated alert displays the detailed alert description, remediation steps, and device ID for each device that triggered an alert. The alert severity and direct investigation is accessible using Log Analytics.

**To investigate security alert details**:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to **IoT Hub** > **`Your hub`** > **Defender for IoT** > **Security Alerts**.

1. Select any security alert from the list to open it.

1. Review the alert **description**, **severity**, **source of the detection**, and **device details** of all devices that issued this alert in the aggregation period.
