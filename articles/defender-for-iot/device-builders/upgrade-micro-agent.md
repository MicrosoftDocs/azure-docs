In version 4.1.2, the standalone micro agent directory changed to align with standard Linux installation directory structures. This change requires customers to reauthenticate the micro agent and modify the connection string location.

1. Upgrade your micro agent as described [above](#upgrade-a-standalone-micro-agent).

1. Reauthenticate your micro agent. For more information, see [Authenticate the micro agent](tutorial-standalone-agent-binary-installation.md#authenticate-the-micro-agent).

## Install a specific version of the micro agent

```bash
sudo apt-get install defender-iot-micro-agent=<version>
```
