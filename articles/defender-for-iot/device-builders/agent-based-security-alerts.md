Defender for IoT continuously analyzes your IoT solution using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to alert you to malicious activity.
In addition, you can create custom alerts based on your knowledge of expected device behavior.
An alert acts as an indicator of potential compromise, and should be investigated and remediated.

In this article, you will find a list of built-in alerts, which can be triggered on your IoT devices.
In addition to built-in alerts, Defender for IoT allows you to define custom alerts based on expected IoT Hub and/or device behavior.
For more information, see [customizable alerts](concept-customizable-security-alerts.md).
