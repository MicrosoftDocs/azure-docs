# Micro agent security alerts

Defender for IoT continuously analyzes your IoT solution using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to alert you to malicious activity.
In addition, you can create custom alerts based on your knowledge of expected device behavior.
An alert acts as an indicator of potential compromise, and should be investigated and remediated.

In this article, you'll find a list of built-in alerts, which can be triggered on your IoT devices.

## Security alerts

### High severity

| Name | Severity | Data Source | Description | Suggested remediation steps | Alert type |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Binary Command Line | High | Defender-IoT-micro-agent | LA Linux binary being called/executed from the command line was detected. This process may be legitimate activity, or an indication that your device is compromised. | Review the command with the user that ran it and check if this is something legitimately expected to run on the device. If not, escalate the alert to your information security team. | IoT_BinaryCommandLine |
| Disable firewall | High | Defender-IoT-micro-agent | Possible manipulation of on-host firewall detected. Malicious actors often disable the on-host firewall in an attempt to exfiltrate data. | Review with the user that ran the command to confirm if this was legitimate expected activity on the device.
