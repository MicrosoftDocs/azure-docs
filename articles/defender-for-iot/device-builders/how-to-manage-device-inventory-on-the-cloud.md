# Manage your IoT devices with the device inventory

The device inventory can be used to view device systems, and network information. The search, filter, edit columns, and export tools can be used to manage this information.

Some of the benefits of the device inventory include:

- Identify all IOT, and OT devices from different inputs. For example, allowing you to understand which devices in your environment aren't communicating, and will require troubleshooting.

- Group, and filter devices by site, type, or vendor.

- Gain visibility into each device, and investigate the different threats, and alerts for each one.

- Export the entire device inventory to a CSV file for your reports.

## Device inventory overview

The Device inventory gives you an overview of all devices within your environment. Here you can see the individual details of each device and filter, and order your search by various options.

The following table describes the different device properties in the device inventory.
