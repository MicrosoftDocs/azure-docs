# OT monitoring - build your own physical appliance

This article lists the hardware specifications required if you want to install Microsoft Defender for IoT OT sensor and on-premises management console software on your own physical appliances.

Microsoft support teams will be better able to assist deployments using pre-configured appliances which are available in our labs.  

> [!TIP]
> [Pre-configured physical appliances](ot-pre-configured-appliances.md) have been validated for Defender for IoT OT system monitoring, and have the following advantages over installing your own software:
>
>- **Performance** over the total assets monitored
>- **Compatibility** with new Defender for IoT releases, with validations for upgrades and driver support
>- **Stability**, validated physical appliances undergo traffic monitoring and packet loss tests
>- **In-lab experience**, Microsoft support teams train using validated physical appliances and have a working knowledge of the hardware
>- **Availability**, components are selected to offer long-term worldwide availability
>

## OS compatibility

Defender for IoT sensor and on-premises management console software is built on Ubuntu 18.04.
All hardware components must be compatible with Ubuntu version 18.04 and later versions.
