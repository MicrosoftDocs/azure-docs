## Corporate IT/OT Mixed Environments

Use the following deployment sizing for high bandwidth corporate IT/OT mixed networks:

|Name  |Max throughput (OT Traffic) |Max monitored Assets  |Deployment |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|[Corporate]    | 3 Gbps        | 12 K        |Physical / Virtual         |

## Enterprise monitoring at the site level

Use the following deployment for enterprise monitoring at the site level:

|Name  |Max throughput (OT Traffic)  |Max monitored assets  |Deployment  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|[Enterprise]    |1 Gbps         |10K         |Physical / Virtual         |

## Production line monitoring

Use the following deployment for production line monitoring:

|Name  |Max throughput (OT Traffic)  |Max monitored assets  |Deployment  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|[SMB]    | 200 Mbps        |   1,000      |Physical / Virtual         |
|[Office]    | 60 Mbps        |   800      | Physical / Virtual        |
|[Rugged]    | 10 Mbps        |   100      |Physical / Virtual|

## On-premises management console systems

On-premises management consoles are supported for enterprise deployment systems. Use the following deployment when working with an on-premises management console:

|Name  |Max monitored sensors  |Deployment  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|[Enterprise]    |Up to 300         |Physical / Virtual         |

## Next steps

Continue understanding system requirements, including options for ordering pre-configured appliances, or required specifications to install software on your own appliances:
