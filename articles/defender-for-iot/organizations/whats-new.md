## On-premises management console retirement

The legacy on-premises management console won't be available for download after **January 1st, 2025**. We recommend transitioning to the new architecture using the full spectrum of on-premises and cloud APIs before this date. For more information, see [on-premises management console retirement](ot-deploy/on-premises-management-console-retirement.md).

## January 2025

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | - [Aggregating multiple alerts violations with the same parameters](#aggregating-multiple-alerts-violations-with-the-same-parameters)|

### Aggregating multiple alerts violations with the same parameters

To reduce alert fatigue, multiple versions of the same alert violation and with the same parameters are grouped together and listed in the alerts table as one item. The alert details pane lists each of the identical alert violations in the **Violations** tab and the appropriate remediation actions are listed in the **Take action** tab. For more information, see [aggregating alerts with the same parameters](alerts.md#aggregating-alert-violations).

## December 2024

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | - [Support Multiple Source Devices in DDoS Attack Alerts](#support-multiple-source-devices-in-ddos-attack-alerts) |

### Support Multiple Source Devices in DDoS Attack Alerts

Alert details now display up to 10 source devices involved in DDoS attack.


## October 2024

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | - [Add wildcards to allowlist domain names](#add-wildcards-allowlist-domain-names)<br> - [Added protocol](#added-protocol) <br> - [New sensor setting type Public addresses](#new-sensor-setting-type-public-addresses) <br>  - [Improved OT sensor onboarding](#improved-ot-sensor-onboarding) |

### Add wildcards allowlist domain names

When adding domain names to the FQDN allowlist use the `*` wildcard to include all sub-domains. For more information, see [allow internet connections on an OT network](how-to-accelerate-alert-incident-response.md#allow-internet-connections-on-an-ot-network).

### Added protocol

We now support the OCPI protocol. See [the updated protocol list](concept-supported-protocols.md#supported-protocols-for-ot-device-discovery).

### New sensor setting type Public addresses

We're adding the **Public addresses** type to the sensor settings that allows you to register the public addresses of internal devices and ensure that the sensor doesn't treat them as internet communication. For more information, see [add sensor settings](configure-sensor-settings-portal.md#add-sensor-settings).

### Improved OT sensor onboarding

If there are connection problems, during sensor onboarding, between the OT sensor and the Azure portal at the configuration stage, the process can't be completed until the connection problem is solved.

We now support completing the configuration process without the need to solve the communication problem, allowing you to continue the onboarding of your OT sensor quickly and solve the problem at a later time. For more information, see [activate your OT sensor](ot-deploy/activate-deploy-sensor.md#activate-your-ot-sensor).

## July 2024

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | - [Security update](#security-update) |

### Security update

This update resolves a CVE, which is listed in [software version 24.1.4 feature documentation](release-notes.md#version-2414).

## June 2024

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | - [Malicious URL path alert](#malicious-url-path-alert)<br> - [Newly supported protocols](#newly-supported-protocols)|

### Malicious URL path alert

The new alert, Malicious URL path, allows users to identify malicious paths in legitimate URLs. The Malicious URL path alert expands Defender for IoT's threat identification to include generic URL signatures, crucial for countering a wide range of cyber threats.

For more information, this alert is described in the [Malware engine alerts table](alert-engine-messages.md#malware-engine-alerts).  

### Newly supported protocols

We now support the Open protocol. [See the updated protocol list](concept-supported-protocols.md).

## April 2024

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | - [Single sign-on for the sensor console](#single-sign-on-for-the-sensor-console)<br>- [Sensor time drift detection](#sensor-time-drift-detection)<br>- [Security update](#security-update-1) |

### Single sign-on for the sensor console

You can set up single sign-on (SSO) for the Defender for IoT sensor console using Microsoft Entra ID. SSO allows simple sign in for your organization's users, allows your organization to meet regulation standards, and increases your security posture. With SSO, your users don't need multiple login credentials across different sensors and sites.

Using Microsoft Entra ID simplifies the onboarding and offboarding processes, reduces administrative overhead, and ensures consistent access controls across the organization.

:::image type="content" source="media/set-up-sso/sso-sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor console login screen with SSO.":::

For more information, see [Set up single sign-on on for the sensor console](set-up-sso.md).

### Sensor time drift detection

This version introduces a new troubleshooting test in the connectivity tool feature, specifically designed to identify time drift issues.

One common challenge when connecting sensors to Defender for IoT in the Azure portal arises from discrepancies in the sensor’s UTC time, which can lead to connectivity problems. To address this issue, we recommend that you configure a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server [in the sensor settings](configure-sensor-settings-portal.md#ntp).

### Security update

This update resolves six CVEs, which are listed in [software version 24.1.3 feature documentation](release-notes.md#version-2413).

## February 2024

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | **Version 24.1.2**:<br> - [Alert suppression rules from the Azure portal (Public preview)](#alert-suppression-rules-from-the-azure-portal-public-preview)<br>- [Focused alerts in OT/IT environments](#focused-alerts-in-otit-environments)<br>- [Alert ID now aligned on the Azure portal and sensor console](#alert-id-now-aligned-on-the-azure-portal-and-sensor-console)<br>- [Newly supported protocols](#newly-supported-protocols-1)<br><br>**Cloud features**<br>- [New license renewal reminder in the Azure portal](#new-license-renewal-reminder-in-the-azure-portal) <br><br>- [New OT appliance hardware profile](#new-ot-appliance-hardware-profile) <br><br>- [New fields for SNMP MIB OIDs](#new-fields-for-snmp-mib-oids)|

### Alert suppression rules from the Azure portal (Public preview)

Now you can configure alert suppression rules from the Azure portal to instruct your OT sensors to specified traffic on your network that would otherwise trigger an alert.

- Configure which alerts to suppress by specifying an alert title, IP/MAC address, hostname, subnet, sensor, or site.
- Set each suppression rule to be active always, or only during a predefined period, such as for a specific maintenance window.

> [!TIP]
> If you're currently using exclusion rules on the on-premises management console, we recommend that you migrate them to suppression rules on the Azure portal. 
For more information, see [Suppress irrelevant alerts](how-to-accelerate-alert-incident-response.md#suppress-irrelevant-alerts).

### Focused alerts in OT/IT environments

Organizations where sensors are deployed between OT and IT networks deal with many alerts, related to both OT and IT traffic. The number of alerts, some of which are irrelevant, can cause alert fatigue and affect overall performance.

To address these challenges, we've updated Defender for IoT's detection policy to automatically trigger alerts based on business impact and network context, and reduce low-value IT related alerts.  

This update is available in sensor version 24.1.3 and later.

For more information, see [Focused alerts in OT/IT environments](alerts.md#focused-alerts-in-otit-environments).

### Alert ID now aligned on the Azure portal and sensor console

The alert ID in the **Id** column on the Azure portal **Alerts** page now displays the same alert ID as the sensor console. [Learn more about alerts on the Azure portal](how-to-manage-cloud-alerts.md#view-alerts-on-the-azure-portal).

> [!NOTE]
> If the [alert was merged with other alerts](alerts.md#alert-management-options) from sensors that detected the same alert, the Azure portal displays the alert ID of the first sensor that generated the alerts.

### Newly supported protocols

We now support these protocols:

- HART-IP
- FANUC FOCAS
- Dicom
- ABB NetConfig
- Rockwell AADvance Discover
- Rockwell AADvance SNCP/IXL
- Schneider NetManage

[See the updated protocol list](concept-supported-protocols.md).

### L60 hardware profile is no longer supported

The L60 hardware profile is no longer supported and is removed from support documentation. Hardware profiles now require a minimum of 100GB (the minimum hardware profile is now [L100](ot-virtual-appliances.md)).

To migrate from the L60 profile to a supported profile follow the [Back up and restore OT network sensor](back-up-restore-sensor.md) procedure.

### New license renewal reminder in the Azure portal

When the license for one or more of your OT sites is about to expire, a note is visible at the top of Defender for IoT in the Azure portal, reminding you to renew your licenses. To continue to get security value from Defender for IoT, select the link in the note to renew the relevant licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Learn more about [Defender for IoT billing](billing.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/license-renewal-note.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the license renewal reminder note." lightbox="media/whats-new/license-renewal-note.png":::

### New OT appliance hardware profile

The DELL XE4 SFF appliance is now supported for OT sensors monitoring production lines. This is part of the L500 hardware profile, a *Production line* environment, with six cores, 8-GB RAM, and 512-GB disk storage.

For more information, see [DELL XE4 SFF](appliance-catalog/dell-xe4-sff.md).

### New fields for SNMP MIB OIDs

Additional standard, generic fields have been added to the SNMP MiB OIDs. For the full list of fields, see [OT sensor OIDs for manual SNMP configurations](how-to-set-up-snmp-mib-monitoring.md#ot-sensor-oids-for-manual-snmp-configurations).

## January 2024

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | [Sensor update in Azure portal now supports selecting a specific version](#sensor-update-in-azure-portal-now-supports-selecting-a-specific-version) |

### Sensor update in Azure portal now supports selecting a specific version

When you update the sensor in the Azure portal, you can now choose to update to any of the supported, previous versions (versions other than the latest version). Previously, sensors onboarded to Microsoft Defender for IoT on the Azure portal were automatically updated to the latest version.

You might want to update your sensor to a specific version for various reasons, such as for testing purposes, or to align all sensors to the same version.

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/send-package-multiple-versions-400.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sensor update pane with option to choose sensor update version." border="false" lightbox="media/whats-new/send-package-multiple-versions.png" :::

For more information, see [Update Defender for IoT OT monitoring software](update-ot-software.md#send-the-software-update-to-your-ot-sensor).
| **OT networks** |**Version 24.1.0**: <br>- [Alert suppression rules from the Azure portal (Public preview)](#alert-suppression-rules-from-the-azure-portal-public-preview)|

## December 2023

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | [New architecture for hybrid and air-gapped support](#new-architecture-for-hybrid-and-air-gapped-support) <br><br> **Version 23.2.0**: <br>- [OT network sensors now run on Debian 11](#ot-network-sensors-now-run-on-debian-11)<br>-  [Default privileged user is now admin instead of support](#default-privileged-user-is-now-admin-instead-of-support) <br><br>**Cloud features**:<br>- [Live statuses for cloud-based sensor updates](#live-statuses-for-cloud-based-sensor-updates)<br> - [Streamlined alert records in the SecurityAlert table](#streamlined-alert-records-in-the-securityalert-table)|

### OT network sensors now run on Debian 11

Sensor version 23.2.0 run on a Debian 11 operating system instead of Ubuntu. Debian is a Linux-based operating system that's widely used for servers and embedded devices, and is known for being leaner than other operating systems, and its stability, security, and extensive hardware support.

Using Debian as the base for our sensor software helps reduce the number of packages installed on the sensors, increasing efficiency and security of your systems.

Due to the operating system switch, the software update from your legacy version to version 23.2.0 might be longer and heavier than usual. 

For more information, see [Back up and restore OT network sensors from the sensor console](back-up-restore-sensor.md) and [Update Defender for IoT OT monitoring software](update-ot-software.md).

### Default privileged user is now admin instead of support

Starting with version 23.2.0, the default, privileged user installed with new OT sensor installations is the *admin* user instead of the *support* user.

For example, use the privileged *admin* user in the following scenarios:

- Signing into a new sensor for the first time after installation. For more information, see [Configure and activate your OT sensor](ot-deploy/activate-deploy-sensor.md).

- Using the Defender for IoT CLI. For more information, see [Work with Defender for IoT CLI commands](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md).

- Accessing the sensor's **Support** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're updating your sensor software from a previous version to version 23.2.0, the privileged *support* user is automatically renamed to *admin*. If you've saved your *support* credentials, such as in CLI scripts, you must update your scripts to use the new *admin* user instead.
>
> The legacy *support* user is available and supported only on versions earlier than 23.2.0.

For more information, see [On-premises users and roles for OT monitoring with Defender for IoT](roles-on-premises.md).

### New architecture for hybrid and air-gapped support

Hybrid and air-gapped networks are common in many industries, such as government, financial services, or industrial manufacturing. Air-gapped networks are physically separated from other, unsecured external networks like enterprise networks or the internet, and are less vulnerable to cyber-attacks. However, air-gapped networks are still not completely secure, can still be breached, and must be secured and monitored carefully.

Defender for IoT now provides new guidance for connecting to and monitoring hybrid and air-gapped networks. The new architecture guidance is designed to add efficiency, security, and reliability to your SOC operations, with fewer components to maintain and troubleshoot. The sensor technology used in the new architecture allows for on-premises processing that keeps data within your own network, reducing the need for cloud resources and improving performance.

The following image shows a sample, high level architecture of our recommendations for monitoring and maintaining Defender for IoT systems, where each OT sensor connects to multiple security management systems in the cloud or on-premises.

:::image type="content" source="media/on-premises-architecture/on-premises-architecture.png" alt-text="Diagram of the new architecture for hybrid and air-gapped support." lightbox="media/on-premises-architecture/on-premises-architecture.png" border="false":::

In this sample image, communication for alerts, syslog messages, and APIs is shown in a solid black line. On-premises management communication is shown in a solid purple line, and cloud / hybrid management communication is shown in a dotted black line.

We recommend that existing customers who are currently using an on-premises management console to manage OT sensors transition to the updated architecture guidance.

For more information, see [Deploy hybrid or air-gapped OT sensor management](ot-deploy/air-gapped-deploy.md).

#### On-premises management console retirement

The [legacy on-premises management console](legacy-central-management/legacy-air-gapped-deploy.md) won't be available for download after **January 1st, 2025**. We recommend transitioning to the new architecture using the full spectrum of on-premises and cloud APIs before this date.

- Sensor versions released after **January 1, 2025** won't be able to be managed by an on-premises management console.

- Sensor software versions released between **January 1st, 2024 – January 1st, 2025** will continue to support an on-premises management console release.

- Air-gapped sensors that cannot connect to the cloud can be managed directly via the sensor console or using REST APIs.

For more information, see:

- [Transitioning from a legacy on-premises management console](ot-deploy/transition-on-premises-management-console-to-cloud.md)
- [Versioning and support for on-premises software versions](release-notes.md#versioning-and-support-for-on-premises-software-versions)

### Live statuses for cloud-based sensor updates

When running a sensor update from the Azure portal, a new progress bar appears in the **Sensor version** column during the update process. As the update progresses the bar shows the percentage of the update completed, showing you that the process is ongoing, isn't stuck or has failed. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/sensor-version-update-bar.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the update bar in the Sensor version column." lightbox="media/whats-new/sensor-version-update-bar.png":::

For more information, see [Update Defender for IoT OT monitoring software](update-ot-software.md).

### Streamlined alert records in the SecurityAlert table
When integrating with Microsoft Sentinel, the Microsoft Sentinel **SecurityAlert** table is now updated immediately only for changes in alert status and severity. Other changes in alerts, such as last detection of an existing alert, are aggregated over several hours and display only the latest change made.

For more information, see [Understand multiple records per alert](iot-solution.md#understand-multiple-records-per-alert).

## November 2023

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **Enterprise IoT networks** | [Enterprise IoT protection now included in Microsoft 365 E5 and E5 Security licenses](#enterprise-iot-protection-now-included-in-microsoft-365-e5-and-e5-security-licenses) |
| **OT networks** | [Updated security stack integration guidance](#updated-security-stack-integration-guidance)|

### Enterprise IoT protection now included in Microsoft 365 E5 and E5 Security licenses

Enterprise IoT (EIoT) security with Defender for IoT discovers unmanaged IoT devices and also provides added security value, including continuous monitoring, vulnerability assessments and tailored recommendations specifically designed for Enterprise IoT devices. Seamlessly integrated with Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on the Microsoft Defender Portal, it ensures a holistic approach to safeguarding an organization's network.

Defender for IoT EIoT monitoring is now automatically supported as part of the Microsoft 365 E5 (ME5) and E5 Security plans, covering up to five devices per user license. For example, if your organization possesses 500 ME5 licenses, you can use Defender for IoT to monitor up to 2500 EIoT devices. This integration represents a significant leap toward fortifying your IoT ecosystem within the Microsoft 365 environment.

- **Customers who have ME5 or E5 Security plans but aren't yet using Defender for IoT for their EIoT devices** must [toggle on support](eiot-defender-for-endpoint.md) in the Microsoft Defender Portal.

- **New customers** without an ME5 or E5 Security plan can purchase a standalone, **Microsoft Defender for IoT - EIoT Device License - add-on** license, as an add-on to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2. Purchase standalone licenses from the Microsoft admin center.

- **Existing customers with both legacy Enterprise IoT plans and ME5/E5 Security plans** are automatically switched to the new licensing method. Enterprise IoT monitoring is now bundled into your license, at no extra charge, and with no action item required from you.

- **Customers with legacy Enterprise IoT plans and no ME5/E5 Security plans** can continue to use their existing plans until the plans expire.

Trial licenses are available for Defender for Endpoint P2 customers as standalone licenses. Trial licenses support 100 number of devices.

### Updated security stack integration guidance

Defender for IoT is refreshing its security stack integrations to improve the overall robustness, scalability, and ease of maintenance of various security solutions.

If you're integrating your security solution with cloud-based systems, we recommend that you use data connectors through [Microsoft Sentinel](concept-sentinel-integration.md). For on-premises integrations, we recommend that you either configure your OT sensor to [forward syslog events](how-to-forward-alert-information-to-partners.md)), or use [Defender for IoT APIs](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-apis.md).

The legacy Aruba ClearPass, Palo Alto Panorama, and Splunk integrations are supported through October 2024 using sensor version 23.1.3, and won't be supported in upcoming major software versions.

For customers using legacy integration methods, we recommend moving your integrations to newly recommended methods. For more information, see:

- [Integrate ClearPass with Microsoft Defender for IoT](tutorial-clearpass.md)
- [Integrate Palo Alto with Microsoft Defender for IoT](tutorial-palo-alto.md)

### Troubleshoot OT sensor connectivity

Starting in version 23.1.3, OT sensors automatically help you troubleshoot connectivity issues with the Azure portal. If a cloud-managed sensor isn't connected, an error is indicated in the Azure portal on the **Sites and sensors** page, and on the sensor's **Overview** page.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/connectivity-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a connectivity error on the Overview page." lightbox="media/release-notes/connectivity-error.png":::

From your sensor, do one of the following to open the **Cloud connectivity troubleshooting** pane, which provides details about the connectivity issues and mitigation steps:

- On the **Overview** page, select the **Troubleshoot** link at the top of the page
- Select **System settings > Sensor management > Health and troubleshooting > Cloud connectivity troubleshooting**

For more information, see [Check sensor - cloud connectivity issues](how-to-troubleshoot-sensor.md#check-sensor---cloud-connectivity-issues).

### Event timeline access for OT sensor Read Only users

Starting in version 23.1.3, *Read Only* users on the OT sensor can view the **Event Timeline** page. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/track-sensor-activity/event-timeline-view-events.png" alt-text="Screenshot of events on the event timeline." lightbox="media/track-sensor-activity/event-timeline-view-events.png":::

- [Create data mining queries](how-to-create-data-mining-queries.md)

## July 2023

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | **Version 23.1.2**: <br>- [OT sensor installation and setup enhancements](#ot-sensor-installation-and-setup-enhancements) <br>- [Analyze and fine tune your deployment](#analyze-and-fine-tune-your-deployment) <br>- [Configure monitored interfaces via the sensor GUI](#configure-monitored-interfaces-via-the-sensor-gui)<br>- [Simplified privileged users](#simplified-privileged-users) <br><br>[Migrate to site-based licenses](#migrate-to-site-based-licenses) |

### OT sensor installation and setup enhancements

In version 23.1.2, we've updated the OT sensor installation and setup wizards to be quicker and more user-friendly. Updates include:

- **Installation wizard**: If you're installing software on your own physical or virtual machines, the Linux installation wizard now goes directly through the installation process without requiring any input or details from you.

    You can watch the installation run from a deployment workstation, but you might also choose to install the software without using a keyboard or screen, and let the installation run automatically. When it's done, access the sensor from the browser using the default IP address.

    - The installation uses default values for your network settings. Fine-tune these settings afterwards, either in the CLI as before, or in a new, browser-based wizard.

    - All sensors are installed with a default *support* user and password. Change the default password immediately with the first sign-in.

- **Configure initial setup in the browser**: After installing software and configuring your initial network settings, continue with the same browser-based wizard to activate your sensor and define SSL/TLS certificate settings.

For more information, see [Install and set up your OT sensor](ot-deploy/install-software-ot-sensor.md) and [Configure and activate your OT sensor](ot-deploy/activate-deploy-sensor.md).

### Analyze and fine tune your deployment

After completing the installation and initial setup, analyze the traffic that the sensor detects by default from the sensor settings. On the sensor, select **Sensor settings** > **Basic** > **Deployment** to analyze the current detections.

You might find that you need to fine tune your deployment, such as changing the sensor's location in the network, or verifying that your monitoring interfaces are connected correctly. Select **Analyze** again after making any changes to see the updated monitoring state. 

For more information, see [Analyze your deployment](how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored.md#analyze-your-deployment).

### Configure monitored interfaces via the sensor GUI

If you want to modify the interfaces used to monitor your traffic after the initial sensor setup, now you can use the new **Sensor settings** > **Interface configurations** page to update your settings instead of the Linux wizard accessed by CLI. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/integration-configurations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Integration configurations page on the OT sensor.":::

The **Interface configurations** page shows the same options as the **Interface configurations** tab in the [initial setup wizard](ot-deploy/activate-deploy-sensor.md#define-the-interfaces-you-want-to-monitor).

For more information, see [Update a sensor's monitoring interfaces (configure ERSPAN)](../how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#update-a-sensors-monitoring-interfaces-configure-erspan).

### Simplified privileged users

In new sensor installations of version 23.1.2, only the privileged *support* user is available by default. The *cyberx* and *cyberx_host* users are available, but are disabled by default. If you need to use these users, such as for [Defender for IoT CLI](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md) access, [change the user password](manage-users-sensor.md#change-a-sensor-users-password).

In sensors that have been updated from previous versions to 23.1.2, the *cyberx* and *cyberx_host* users remain enabled as before.

> [!TIP]
> To run CLI commands that are available only to the *cyberx* or *cyberx_host* users when signed in as the *support* user, make sure to first access the host machine's system root. For more information, see [Access the system root as an *admin* user](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md#access-the-system-root-as-an-admin-user).

### Migrate to site-based licenses

Existing customers can now migrate their legacy Defender for IoT purchasing plans to a **Microsoft 365** plan, based on site-based, Microsoft 365 licenses.

On the **Plans and pricing** page, edit your plan and select the **Microsoft 365** plan instead of your current monthly or annual plan. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/migrate-to-365.png" alt-text="Screenshot of updating your pricing plan to Microsoft 365."  lightbox="media/release-notes/migrate-to-365.png":::

### Support for transient devices

Defender for IoT now identifies *transient* devices as a unique device type that represents devices that were detected for only a short time. We recommend investigating these devices carefully to understand their impact on your network.

For more information, see [Defender for IoT device inventory](device-inventory.md) and [Manage your device inventory from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-device-inventory-for-organizations.md).

### Learn DNS traffic by configuring allowlists

The *support* user can now decrease the number of unauthorized internet alerts by creating an allowlist of domain names on your OT sensor.

When a DNS allowlist is configured, the sensor checks each unauthorized internet connectivity attempt against the list before triggering an alert. If the domain's FQDN is included in the allowlist, the sensor doesn’t trigger the alert and allows the traffic automatically.

All OT sensor users can view the list of allowed DNS domains and their resolved IP addresses in data mining reports.  

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/data-mining-allowlist.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to create a data mining report for DNS allowlists.":::

For more information, see [Allow internet connections on an OT network](how-to-accelerate-alert-incident-response.md#allow-internet-connections-on-an-ot-network) and [Create data mining queries](how-to-create-data-mining-queries.md).

### Security recommendations for OT networks (Public preview)

Defender for IoT now provides security recommendations to help customers manage their OT/IoT network security posture. Defender for IoT recommendations help users form actionable, prioritized mitigation plans that address the unique challenges of OT/IoT networks. Use recommendations for lower your network's risk and attack surface.

You can see the following security recommendations from the Azure portal for detected devices across your networks:

- **Review PLC operating mode**. Devices with this recommendation are found with PLCs set to unsecure operating mode states. We recommend setting PLC operating modes to the **Secure Run** state if access is no longer required to the PLC to reduce the threat of malicious PLC programming.

- **Review unauthorized devices**. Devices with this recommendation must be identified and authorized as part of the network baseline. We recommend taking action to identify any indicated devices. Disconnect any devices from your network that remain unknown even after investigation to reduce the threat of rogue or potentially malicious devices.

Access security recommendations from one of the following locations:

- The **Recommendations** page, which displays all current recommendations across all detected OT devices.

- The **Recommendations** tab on a device details page, which displays all current recommendations for the selected device.

    For more information, see [Use Azure Monitor workbooks in Microsoft Defender for IoT](workbooks.md).

### Updates for Azure cloud connection firewall rules (Public preview)

OT network sensors connect to Azure to provide alert and device data and sensor health messages, access threat intelligence packages, and more. Connected Azure services include IoT Hub, Blob Storage, Event Hubs, and the Microsoft Download Center.

For OT sensors with software versions 22.x and higher, Defender for IoT now supports increased security when adding outbound allow rules for connections to Azure. Now you can define your outbound allow rules to connect to Azure without using wildcards.

When defining outbound *allow* rules to connect to Azure, you need to enable HTTPS traffic to each of the required endpoints on port 443. Outbound *allow* rules are defined once for all OT sensors onboarded to the same subscription.

For supported sensor versions, download the full list of required secure endpoints from the following locations in the Azure portal:

- **A successful sensor registration page**: After onboarding a new OT sensor with version 22.x, the successful registration page now provides instructions for next steps, including a link to the endpoints you'll need to add as secure outbound allow rules on your network. Select the **Download endpoint details** link to download the JSON file.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/download-endpoints.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a successful OT sensor registration page with the download endpoints link.":::

- **The Sites and sensors page**: Select an OT sensor with software versions 22.x or higher, or a site with one or more supported sensor versions. Then, select **More actions** > **Download endpoint details** to download the JSON file. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/download-endpoints-sites-sensors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sites and sensors page with the download endpoint details link.":::

For more information, see:

- [Tutorial: Get started with Microsoft Defender for IoT for OT security](tutorial-onboarding.md)
- [Manage sensors with Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md)
- [Networking requirements](networking-requirements.md#sensor-access-to-azure-portal)

### Investigation enhancements with IoT device entities in Microsoft Sentinel

Defender for IoT's integration with Microsoft Sentinel now supports an IoT device entity page. When investigating incidents and monitoring IoT security in Microsoft Sentinel, you can now identify your most sensitive devices and jump directly to more details on each device entity page.

The IoT device entity page provides contextual device information about an IoT device, with basic device details and device owner contact information. Device owners are defined by site in the **Sites and sensors** page in Defender for IoT.

The IoT device entity page can help prioritize remediation based on device importance and business impact, as per each alert's site, zone, and sensor. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/iot-device-entity-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the IoT device entity page in Microsoft Sentinel.":::

You can also now hunt for vulnerable devices on the Microsoft Sentinel **Entity behavior** page. For example, view the top five IoT devices with the highest number of alerts, or search for a device by IP address or device name:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/entity-behavior-iot-devices-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Entity behavior page in Microsoft Sentinel.":::

For more information, see [Investigate further with IoT device entities](../../sentinel/iot-advanced-threat-monitoring.md#investigate-further-with-iot-device-entities) and [Site management options from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#site-management-options-from-the-azure-portal).

### Updates to the Microsoft Defender for IoT solution in Microsoft Sentinel's content hub

This month, we've released version 2.0 of the **Microsoft Defender for IoT** solution in Microsoft Sentinel's content hub, previously known as the **IoT/OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution.

Updates in this version of the solution include:

- **A name change**. If you'd previously installed the **IoT/OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, the solution is automatically renamed to **Microsoft Defender for IoT**, even if you don't update the solution.

- **Workbook improvements**: The **Defender for IoT** workbook now includes:

    - A new **Overview** dashboard with key metrics on the device inventory, threat detection, and security posture. For example:

        :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/sentinel-workbook-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Overview tab in the IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT workbook." lightbox="media/release-notes/sentinel-workbook-overview.png":::

    - A new **Vulnerabilities** dashboard with details about CVEs shown in your network and their related vulnerable devices. For example:

        :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/sentinel-workbook-vulnerabilities.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Vulnerability tab in the IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT workbook." lightbox="media/release-notes/sentinel-workbook-vulnerabilities.png":::

    - Improvements on the **Device inventory** dashboard, including access to device recommendations, vulnerabilities, and direct links to the Defender for IoT device details pages. The **Device inventory** dashboard in the **IoT/OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** workbook is fully aligned with the Defender for IoT [device inventory data](how-to-manage-device-inventory-for-organizations.md).

- **Playbook updates**: The **Microsoft Defender for IoT** solution now supports the following SOC automation functionality with new playbooks:

  - **Automation with CVE details**: Use the *AD4IoT-CVEAutoWorkflow* playbook to enrich incident comments with CVEs of related devices based on Defender for IoT data. The incidents are triaged, and if the CVE is critical, the asset owner is notified about the incident by email.

  - **Automation for email notifications to device owners**. Use the *AD4IoT-SendEmailtoIoTOwner* playbook to have a notification email automatically sent to a device's owner about new incidents. Device owners can then reply to the email to update the incident as needed. Device owners are defined at the site level in Defender for IoT.

  - **Automation for incidents with sensitive devices**:  Use the *AD4IoT-AutoTriageIncident* playbook to automatically update an incident's severity based on the devices involved in the incident, and their sensitivity level or importance to your organization. For example, any incident involving a sensitive device can be automatically escalated to a higher severity level.

For more information, see [Investigate Microsoft Defender for IoT incidents with Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentinel/iot-advanced-threat-monitoring.md?bc=%2fazure%2fdefender-for-iot%2fbreadcrumb%2ftoc.json&toc=%2fazure%2fdefender-for-iot%2forganizations%2ftoc.json).

### Enterprise IoT and Defender for Endpoint integration in GA

The Enterprise IoT integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is now in General Availability (GA). With this update, we've made the following updates and improvements:

- Onboard an Enterprise IoT plan directly in Defender for Endpoint. For more information, see [Manage your subscriptions](how-to-manage-subscriptions.md) and the [Defender for Endpoint documentation](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-microsoft-defender-for-iot-integration).

- Seamless integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to view detected Enterprise IoT devices, and their related alerts, vulnerabilities, and recommendations in the Microsoft 365 Security portal. For more information, see the [Enterprise IoT tutorial](tutorial-getting-started-eiot-sensor.md) and the [Defender for Endpoint documentation](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-microsoft-defender-for-iot-integration). You can continue to view detected Enterprise IoT devices on the Defender for IoT **Device inventory** page in the Azure portal.

- All Enterprise IoT sensors are now automatically added to the same site in Defender for IoT, named **Enterprise network**. When onboarding a new Enterprise IoT device, you only need to define a sensor name and select your subscription, without defining a site or zone.

> [!NOTE]
> The Enterprise IoT network sensor and all detections remain in Public Preview.

### Same passwords for cyberx_host and cyberx users

During OT monitoring software installations and updates, the **cyberx** user is assigned a random password. When you update from version 10.x.x to version 22.1.7, the **cyberx_host** password is assigned with an identical password to the **cyberx** user.

For more information, see [Install OT agentless monitoring software](how-to-install-software.md) and [Update Defender for IoT OT monitoring software](update-ot-software.md).

### Device inventory enhancements

Starting in OT sensor versions 22.2.4, you can now take the following actions from the sensor console's **Device inventory** page:

- **Merge duplicate devices**. You might need to merge devices if the sensor has discovered separate network entities that are associated with a single, unique device. Examples of this scenario might include a PLC with four network cards, a laptop with both WiFi and a physical network card, or a single workstation with multiple network cards.

- **Delete single devices**. Now, you can delete a single device that hasn't communicated for at least 10 minutes.

- **Delete inactive devices by admin users**. Now, all admin users, in addition to the **cyberx** user, can delete inactive devices.

Also starting in version 22.2.4, in the sensor console's **Device inventory** page, the **Last seen** value in the device details pane is replaced by **Last activity**. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/last-activity-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Last activity field showing in the sensor console's device details pane on the Device inventory page.":::

For more information, see [Manage your OT device inventory from a sensor console](how-to-investigate-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md).

### Enhancements for the ServiceNow integration API

OT sensor version 22.2.4 provides enhancements for the `devicecves` API, which gets details about the CVEs found for a given device.

Now you can add any of the following parameters to your query to fine tune your results:

- “**sensorId**” - Shows results from a specific sensor, as defined by the given sensor ID.
- “**score**” - Determines a minimum CVE score to be retrieved. All results have a CVE score equal to or higher than the given value. Default = **0**.
- “**deviceIds**” -  A comma-separated list of device IDs from which you want to show results. For example: **1232,34,2,456**

For more information, see [Integration API reference for on-premises management consoles (Public preview)](api/management-integration-apis.md).

### OT appliance hardware profile updates

We've refreshed the naming conventions for our OT appliance hardware profiles for greater transparency and clarity.

The new names reflect both the *type* of profile, including *Corporate*, *Enterprise*, and *Production line*, and also the related disk storage size.

Use the following table to understand the mapping between legacy hardware profile names and the current names used in the updated software installation:

|Legacy name  |New name  | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Corporate**     |    **C5600** | A *Corporate* environment, with: <br>16 Cores<br>32-GB RAM<br>5.6-TB disk storage |
|**Enterprise**     | **E1800** | An *Enterprise* environment, with: <br>Eight Cores<br>32-GB RAM<br>1.8-TB disk storage        |
|**SMB**    |    **L500**   | A *Production line* environment, with: <br>Four Cores<br>8-GB RAM<br>500-GB disk storage  |
|**Office**     | **L100**  | A *Production line* environment, with: <br>Four Cores<br>8-GB RAM<br>100-GB disk storage      |
|**Rugged**     |   **L64** | A *Production line* environment, with: <br>Four Cores<br>8-GB RAM<br>64-GB disk storage     |

We also now support new enterprise hardware profiles, for sensors supporting both 500 GB and 1-TB disk sizes.

For more information, see [Which appliances do I need?](ot-appliance-sizing.md)

### PCAP access from the Azure portal (Public preview)

Now you can access the raw traffic files, known as packet capture files or PCAP files, directly from the Azure portal. This feature supports SOC or OT security engineers who want to investigate alerts from Defender for IoT or Microsoft Sentinel, without having to access each sensor separately.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/pcap-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Download PCAP button." lightbox="media/release-notes/pcap-request.png":::

PCAP files are downloaded to your Azure storage.

For more information, see [View and manage alerts from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-cloud-alerts.md).

### Bi-directional alert synch between sensors and the Azure portal (Public preview)

For sensors updated to version 22.2.1, alert statuses and learn statuses are now fully synchronized between the sensor console and the Azure portal. For example, this means that you can close an alert on the Azure portal or the sensor console, and the alert status is updated in both locations.

*Learn* an alert from either the Azure portal or the sensor console to ensure that it's not triggered again the next time the same network traffic is detected.

The sensor console is also synchronized with an on-premises management console, so that alert statuses and learn statuses remain up-to-date across your management interfaces.

For more information, see:

- [View and manage alerts from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-cloud-alerts.md)
- [View and manage alerts on your sensor](how-to-view-alerts.md)
- [Work with alerts on the on-premises management console](legacy-central-management/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console.md)

### Sensor connections restored after certificate rotation

Starting in version 22.2.3, after rotating your certificates, your sensor connections are automatically restored to your on-premises management console, and you don't need to reconnect them manually.

For more information, see [Create SSL/TLS certificates for OT appliances](ot-deploy/create-ssl-certificates.md) and [Manage SSL/TLS certificates](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#manage-ssltls-certificates).

### Support diagnostic log enhancements (Public preview)

Starting in sensor version [22.1.1](#new-support-diagnostics-log), you've been able to download a diagnostic log from the sensor console to send to support when you open a ticket.

Now, for locally managed sensors, you can upload that diagnostic log directly on the Azure portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/upload-diagnostics-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Send diagnostic files to support option." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/upload-diagnostics-log.png":::

- The device details pages, accessed either from the **Device map** or **Device inventory** pages, is shown as read only. To modify device properties, select **Edit properties** on the bottom-left.

- The **Data mining** page now includes reporting functionality. While the **Reports** page was removed, users with read-only access can view updates on the **Data mining page** without the ability to modify reports or settings.

    For admin users creating new reports, you can now toggle on a **Send to CM** option to send the report to a central management console as well. For more information, see [Create a report](how-to-create-data-mining-queries.md#create-an-ot-sensor-custom-data-mining-report) 

- The **System settings** area has been reorganized in to sections for *Basic* settings, settings for *Network monitoring*, *Sensor management*, *Integrations*, and *Import settings*.

- The sensor online help now links to key articles in the Microsoft Defender for IoT documentation.

**Defender for IoT maps now include**:

- A new **Map View** is now shown for alerts and on the device details pages, showing where in your environment the alert or device is found.

- Right-click a device on the map to view contextual information about the device, including related alerts, event timeline data, and connected devices.

- Select **Disable Display IT Networks Groups** to prevent the ability to collapse IT networks in the map. This option is turned on by default.

- The **Simplified Map View** option has been removed.

We've also implemented global readiness and accessibility features to comply with Microsoft standards. In the on-premises sensor console, these updates include both high contrast and regular screen display themes and localization for over 15 languages.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/dark-mode.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor console in dark mode." lightbox="media/release-notes/dark-mode.png":::

Access global readiness and accessibility options from the **Settings** icon at the top-right corner of your screen:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/settings-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows localization options." lightbox="media/release-notes/settings-icon.png":::

### Enhanced sensor Overview page

The Defender for IoT sensor portal's **Dashboard** page has been renamed as **Overview**, and now includes data that better highlights system deployment details, critical network monitoring health, top alerts, and important trends and statistics.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/new-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the updated interface." lightbox="media/release-notes/new-interface.png":::

The Overview page also now serves as a *black box* to view your overall sensor status in case your outbound connections, such as to the Azure portal, go down.

Create more dashboards using the **Trends & Statistics** page, located under the **Analyze** menu on the left.

### New support diagnostics log

Now you can get a summary of the log and system information that gets added to your support tickets. In the **Backup and Restore** dialog, select **Support Ticket Diagnostics**.

### Alert updates

**In the Azure portal**:

Alerts are now available in Defender for IoT in the Azure portal. Work with alerts to enhance the security and operation of your IoT/OT network.

The new **Alerts** page is currently in Public Preview, and provides:

- An aggregated, real-time view of threats detected by network sensors.
- Remediation steps for devices and network processes.
- Streaming alerts to Microsoft Sentinel and empower your SOC team.
- Alert storage for 90 days from the time they're first detected.
- Tools to investigate source and destination activity, alert severity and status, MITRE ATT&CK information, and contextual information about the alert.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/mitre.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Alerts page showing MITRE information." lightbox="media/release-notes/mitre.png":::

**On the sensor console**:

On the sensor console, the **Alerts** page now shows details for alerts detected by sensors that are configured with a cloud-connection to Defender for IoT on Azure. Users working with alerts in both Azure and on-premises should understand how alerts are managed between the Azure portal and the on-premises components.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/alerts-in-console.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Alerts page on the sensor console." lightbox="media/release-notes/alerts-in-console.png":::

Other alert updates include:

- **Access contextual data** for each alert, such as events that occurred around the same time, or a map of connected devices. Maps of connected devices are available for sensor console alerts only.

- **Alert statuses** are updated, and, for example,  now include a *Closed* status instead of *Acknowledged*.

- **Alert storage** for 90 days from the time that they're first detected.

- The **Backup Activity with Antivirus Signatures Alert**. This new alert warning is triggered for traffic detected between a source device and destination backup server, which is often legitimate backup activity. Critical or major malware alerts are no longer triggered for such activity.

- **During upgrades**, sensor console alerts that are currently archived are deleted. Pinned alerts are no longer supported, so pins are removed for sensor console alerts as relevant.

For more information, see [View alerts on your sensor](how-to-view-alerts.md).

### Custom alert updates

The sensor console's **Custom alert rules** page now provides:

- Hit count information in the **Custom alert rules** table, with at-a-glance details about the number of alerts triggered in the last week for each rule you've created.

- The ability to schedule custom alert rules to run outside of regular working hours.

- The ability to alert on any field that can be extracted from a protocol using the DPI engine.

- Complete protocol support when creating custom rules, and support for an extensive range of related protocol variables.

For more information, see [Create custom alert rules on an OT sensor](how-to-accelerate-alert-incident-response.md#create-custom-alert-rules-on-an-ot-sensor).

### CLI command updates

The Defender for IoT sensor software installation is now containerized. With the now-containerized sensor, you can use the *cyberx_host* user to investigate issues with other containers or the operating system, or to send files via FTP.

This *cyberx_host* user is available by default and connects to the host machine. If you need to, recover the password for the *cyberx_host* user from the **Sites and sensors** page in Defender for IoT.

As part of the containerized sensor, the following CLI commands have been modified:

|Legacy name  |Replacement  |
|---------|---------|
|`cyberx-xsense-reconfigure-interfaces`    |`sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor`         |
|`cyberx-xsense-reload-interfaces`     |  `sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor`      |
|`cyberx-xsense-reconfigure-hostname`     | `sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor`       |
| `cyberx-xsense-system-remount-disks` |`sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor` |

The `sudo cyberx-xsense-limit-interface-I eth0 -l value` CLI command was removed. This command was used to limit the interface bandwidth that the sensor uses for day-to-day procedures, and is no longer supported.

For more information, see [Defender for IoT installation](how-to-install-software.md), [Work with Defender for IoT CLI commands](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md), and [CLI command reference from OT network sensors](cli-ot-sensor.md).

### Update to version 22.1.x

To use all of Defender for IoT's latest features, make sure to update your sensor software versions to 22.1.x.

If you're on a legacy version, you might need to run a series of updates in order to get to the latest version. You'll also need to update your firewall rules and reactivate your sensor with a new activation file.

After you've upgraded to version 22.1.x, the new upgrade log can be found at the following path, accessed via SSH and the *cyberx_host* user: `/opt/sensor/logs/legacy-upgrade.log`.

For more information, see [Update OT system software](update-ot-software.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrading to version 22.1.x is a large update, and you should expect the update process to require more time than previous updates.
>

### New connectivity model and firewall requirements

Defender for IoT version 22.1.x supports a new set of sensor connection methods that provide simplified deployment, improved security, scalability, and flexible connectivity.

In addition to migration steps, this new connectivity model requires that you open a new firewall rule. For more information, see:

- **New firewall requirements**: [Sensor access to Azure portal](networking-requirements.md#sensor-access-to-azure-portal).
- **Architecture**: [Sensor connection methods](architecture-connections.md)
- **Connection procedures**: [Connect your sensors to Microsoft Defender for IoT](connect-sensors.md)

### Protocol improvements

This version of Defender for IoT provides improved support for:

- Profinet DCP
- Honeywell
- Windows endpoint detection

For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for IoT - supported IoT, OT, ICS, and SCADA protocols](concept-supported-protocols.md).

### Modified, replaced, or removed options and configurations

The following Defender for IoT options and configurations have been moved, removed, and/or replaced:

- Reports previously found on the **Reports** page are now shown on the **Data Mining** page instead. You can also continue to view data mining information directly from the on-premises management console.

- Changing a locally managed sensor name is now supported only by onboarding the sensor to the Azure portal again with the new name. Sensor names can no longer be changed directly from the sensor. For more information, see [Upload a new activation file](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#upload-a-new-activation-file).
