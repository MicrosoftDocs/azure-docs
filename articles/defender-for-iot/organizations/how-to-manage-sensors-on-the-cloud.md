# Manage sensors with Defender for IoT in the Azure portal

This article describes how to view and manage sensors with [Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started).

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the procedures in this article, you need to have network sensors onboarded to Defender for IoT. For more information, see:

- [Onboard OT sensors to Defender for IoT](onboard-sensors.md)
- [Enhance IoT security monitoring with an Enterprise IoT network sensor (Public preview)](eiot-sensor.md)

## View your sensors

All of your currently cloud-connected sensors, including both OT and Enterprise IoT sensors, are listed in the **Sites and sensors** page. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/sites-and-sensors-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Sites and sensors page." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/sites-and-sensors-page.png":::

Details about each sensor are listed in the following columns:

|Column name |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Sensor name**| Displays the name that you assigned to the sensor during the registration. |
|**Sensor type**| Displays whether the sensor is an OT locally connected, OT cloud-connected, or an Enterprise IoT sensor. |
|**Zone**| Displays the zone that contains this sensor.|
|**Subscription name**| Displays the name of the Microsoft Azure account subscription that this sensor belongs to. |
|**Sensor version**| Displays the OT monitoring software version installed on your sensor. |
|**Sensor health**| Displays a [sensor health message](sensor-health-messages.md). For more information, see [Understand sensor health](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#understand-sensor-health).|
|**Last connected (UTC)**| Displays how long ago the sensor was last connected.|
|**Threat Intelligence version**| Displays the [Threat Intelligence version](how-to-work-with-threat-intelligence-packages.md) installed on an OT sensor. The name of the version is based on the day the package was built by Defender for IoT. |
|**Threat Intelligence mode**| Displays whether the Threat Intelligence update mode is *manual* or *automatic*. *Manual* means that you can [push newly released packages directly to sensors](how-to-work-with-threat-intelligence-packages.md) as needed. Otherwise, the new packages are automatically installed on all OT, cloud-connected sensors. |
|**Threat Intelligence update status**| Displays the update status of the Threat Intelligence package on an OT sensor. The status can be either **Failed**, **In Progress**, **Update Available**, or **Ok**.|

## Site management options from the Azure portal

When [onboarding a new OT sensor](onboard-sensors.md) to the Defender for IoT, you can add it to a new or existing site. When working with OT networks, organizing your sensors into sites allows you to manage your sensors more efficiently and align to a [Zero Trust strategy](concept-zero-trust.md) across your network.

Enterprise IoT sensors are all automatically added to the same site, named **Enterprise network**.

**To edit a site from the Azure portal**:

1. Select the site's name on the **Sites and sensors** page. In the **Edit site** pane that opens on the right, modify any of the following values:

    |Option |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Display name**| Enter a meaningful name for your site. |
    | **Owner** | **For OT sites only**. Enter one or more email addresses for the user you want to designate as the owner of the devices at this site. The site owner is inherited by all devices at the site, and is shown on the IoT device entity pages and in incident details in Microsoft Sentinel.<br><br>    In Microsoft Sentinel, use the **AD4IoT-SendEmailtoIoTOwner** and **AD4IoT-CVEAutoWorkflow** playbooks to automatically notify device owners about important alerts or incidents. For more information, see [Investigate and detect threats for IoT devices](../../sentinel/iot-advanced-threat-monitoring.md).|
    |**Tags** | (Optional) Enter values for the **Key** and **Value** fields for each new tag you want to add to your site. Select **+ Add** to add a new tag. |

1. **For OT sites only**: To define specified permissions per site, select **Manage site access control (Preview)**. 

    For example, you might do this as part of a Zero Trust security strategy to add a level of granularity to your Azure access policies. Defender for IoT sites generally reflect many devices grouped in a specific geographical location, such as the devices in an office building at a specific address. 

    For more information, see [Manage site-based access control](manage-users-portal.md#manage-site-based-access-control-public-preview).

1. When you're done, select **Save** to save your changes.

## Sensor management options from the Azure portal

Sensors that you've on-boarded to Defender for IoT are listed on the Defender for IoT **Sites and sensors** page. Select a specific sensor name to drill down to more details for that sensor.

## Retrieve forensics data stored on the sensor

Use Azure Monitor workbooks on an OT network sensor to retrieve forensic data from that sensor’s storage. The following types of forensic data are stored locally on OT sensors, for devices detected by that sensor:

- Device data
- Alert data
- Alert PCAP files
- Event timeline data
- Log files

Each type of data has a different retention period and maximum capacity. For more information, see [Visualize Microsoft Defender for IoT data with Azure Monitor workbooks](workbooks.md) and [Data retention across Microsoft Defender for IoT](references-data-retention.md).

## Reactivate an OT sensor

You may need to reactivate an OT sensor because you want to:

- **Work in cloud-connected mode instead of locally managed mode**: After reactivation, existing sensor detections are displayed in the sensor console, and newly detected alert information is delivered through Defender for IoT in the Azure portal. This information can be shared with other Azure services, such as Microsoft Sentinel.

- **Work in locally managed mode instead of cloud-connected mode**: After reactivation, sensor detection information is displayed only in the sensor console.

- **Associate the sensor to a new site**:  Re-register the sensor with new site definitions and use the new activation file to activate.

- **Change your plan commitment**: If you make changes to your plan, such as changing your price plan from a trial to a monthly commitment, you need to reactivate your sensors to reflect the new changes.

In such cases, do the following steps:

1. [Delete your existing sensor](#sensor-management-options-from-the-azure-portal).
1. [Onboard the sensor again](onboard-sensors.md), registering it with any new settings.
1. [Upload your new activation file](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#upload-a-new-activation-file).

## Understand sensor health

This procedure describes how to view sensor health data from the Azure portal. Sensor health includes data such as whether traffic is stable, the sensor is overloaded, notifications about sensor software versions, and more.

**To view overall sensor health**:

1. From Defender for IoT in the Azure portal, select **Sites and sensors** and then check the overall health score in the widget above the grid. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/sensor-health-widgets.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the sensor health widgets." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/sensor-health-widgets.png":::

    **Unsupported** means that the sensor has a software version installed that is no longer supported.

    **Unhealthy** indicates one of the following scenarios:

    - Sensor traffic to Azure isn't stable
    - Sensor fails regular sanity tests
    - No traffic detected by the sensor
    - Sensor software version is no longer supported
    - A [remote sensor upgrade from the Azure portal](update-ot-software.md#update-ot-sensors) fails

    For more information, see our [Sensor health message reference](sensor-health-messages.md).

1. To check on specific sensor issues, filter the grid by sensor health, and select one or more issues to verify. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/sensor-health-filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor health filter." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/sensor-health-filters.png":::

1. Expand the filtered sites and sensors now displayed in the grid, and use the **Sensor health** column to learn more at a high level.

1. To drill down further and understand recommended actions, select a sensor name to open the sensor details page.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/sensor-details-health.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor details page showing health information." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/sensor-details-health.png":::

    On the sensor details **Overview** page, expand the **Health** section and any messages listed there to learn more. The **Recommendation** column on the right lists recommended actions for handling the health issue.

For more information, see our [Sensor health message reference](sensor-health-messages.md).

## Upload a diagnostics log for support

If you need to open a support ticket for a locally managed sensor, upload a diagnostics log to the Azure portal for the support team.

> [!TIP]
> For cloud-connected sensors, the diagnostics log is automatically available to your support team when you open a support ticket.
>

**To upload a diagnostics report**:

1. Make sure you have the diagnostics report available for upload. For more information, see [Download a diagnostics log for support](how-to-troubleshoot-sensor.md#download-a-diagnostics-log-for-support).

1. In Defender for IoT in the Azure portal, go to the **Sites and sensors** page and select the locally managed sensor that's related to your support ticket.

1. For your selected sensor, select the **...** options menu on the right > **Send diagnostic files to support**. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/upload-diagnostics-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the send diagnostic files to support option." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/upload-diagnostics-log.png":::
