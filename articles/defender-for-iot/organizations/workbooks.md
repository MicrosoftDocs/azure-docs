# Visualize Microsoft Defender for IoT data with Azure Monitor workbooks

Azure Monitor workbooks provide graphs, charts, and dashboards that visually reflect data stored in your Azure Resource Graph subscriptions and are available directly in Microsoft Defender for IoT.

In the Azure portal, use the Defender for IoT **Workbooks** page to view workbooks created by Microsoft and provided out-of-the-box, or created by customers and shared across the community.

Each workbook graph or chart is based on an Azure Resource Graph (ARG) query running on your data. In Defender for IoT, you might use ARG queries to:

- Gather sensor statuses
- Identify new devices in your network
- Find alerts related to specific IP addresses
- Understand which alerts are seen by each sensor

## View workbooks

To view out-of-the-box workbooks created by Microsoft, or other workbooks already saved to your subscription:

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Defender for IoT** and select **Workbooks** on the left.

    :::image type="content" source="media/workbooks/workbooks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Workbooks page." lightbox="media/release-notes/workbooks.png":::

1. Modify your filtering options if needed, and select a workbook to open it.

Defender for IoT provides the following workbooks out-of-the-box:

- **Sensor health**. Displays data about your sensor health, such as the sensor console software versions installed on your sensors.
- **Alerts**. Displays data about alerts occurring on your sensors, including alerts by sensor, alert types, recent alerts generated, and more.
- **Devices**. Displays data about your device inventory, including devices by vendor, subtype, and new devices identified.
- **Vulnerabilities**. Displays data about the Vulnerabilities detected in OT devices across your network. Select an item in the **Device vulnerabilities**, **Vulnerable devices**, or **Vulnerable components** tables to view related information in the tables on the right.

## Create custom workbooks

Use the Defender for IoT **Workbooks** page to create custom Azure Monitor workbooks directly in Defender for IoT.

1. On the **Workbooks** page, select **New**, or to start from another template, open the template workbook and select **Edit**.

1. In your new workbook, select **Add**, and select the option you want to add to your workbook. If you're editing an existing workbook or template, select the options (**...**) button on the right to access the **Add** menu.

    You can add any of the following elements to your workbook:

    |Option  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Text**     |  Add text to describe the graphs shown on your workbook or any additional action required.       |
    |**Parameters**     |  Define parameters to use in your workbook text and queries.       |
    |**Links / tabs**     |  Add navigational elements to your workbook, including lists, links to other targets, extra tabs, or toolbars.       |
    |**Query**     |  Add a query to use when creating your workbook graphs and charts.   <br><br>- Make sure to select **Azure Resource Graph** as your **Data source** and select all of your relevant subscriptions. <br>- Add a graphical representation for your data by selecting a type from the **Visualization** options.  |
    |**Metric**     | Add metrics to use when creating workbook graphs and charts.       |
    |**Group**     |  Add groups to organize your workbooks into sub-areas.       |

    For each option, after you've defined all available settings, select the **Add...** or **Run...** button to create that workbook element. For example, **Add parameter** or **Run Query**.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can build your queries in the [Azure Resource Graph Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/ArgQueryBlade) and copy them into your workbook query.

1. In the toolbar, select **Save** :::image type="icon" source="media/workbooks/save-icon.png" border="false"::: or **Save as** :::image type="icon" source="media/workbooks/save-as-icon.png" border="false"::: to save your workbook, and then select **Done editing**.

1. Select **Workbooks** to go back to the main workbook page with the full workbook listing.

### Reference parameters in your queries

Once you've created a parameter, reference it in your query using the following syntax: `{ParameterName}`. For example:

```kusto
iotsecurityresources
| where type == "microsoft.iotsecurity/sensors"
| extend Name=name
| extend Status= properties.sensorStatus
| where Name=={SensorName}
| project Name,Status
```

## Sample queries

This section provides sample queries that are commonly used in Defender for IoT workbooks.

### Alert queries

**Distribution of alerts across sensors**

```kusto
iotsecurityresources
| where type == "microsoft.iotsecurity/locations/devicegroups/alerts"
| extend Sensor=properties.extendedProperties.SensorId
| where properties.status!='Closed'
| summarize Alerts=count() by tostring(Sensor)
| sort by Alerts desc
```

**New alerts from the last 24 hours**

```kusto
iotsecurityresources
| where type == "microsoft.iotsecurity/locations/devicegroups/alerts"
| where properties.status!='Closed'
| extend AlertTime=properties.startTimeUtc
| extend Type=properties.displayName
| where AlertTime > ago(1d)
| project AlertTime, Type
```

**Alerts by source IP address**

```kusto
iotsecurityresources
| where type == "microsoft.iotsecurity/locations/devicegroups/alerts"
| extend Type=properties.displayName
| extend Source_IP=properties.extendedProperties.SourceDeviceAddress
| extend Destination_IP=properties.extendedProperties.DestinationDeviceAddress
| where Source_IP=='192.168.10.1'
| project Source_IP, Destination_IP, Type
```

### Device queries

**OT device inventory by vendor**

```kusto
iotsecurityresources
| extend Vendor= properties.hardware.vendor
| where properties.deviceDataSource=='OtSensor'
| summarize Devices=count() by tostring(Vendor)
| sort by Devices
```

**OT device inventory by sub-type, such as PLC, embedded device, UPS, and so on**

```kusto
iotsecurityresources
| where type == "microsoft.iotsecurity/locations/devicegroups/devices"
| extend SubType=properties.deviceSubTypeDisplayName
| summarize Devices=count() by tostring(SubType)
| sort by Devices
```

**New OT devices by sensor, site, and IPv4 address**

```kusto
iotsecurityresources
| where type == "microsoft.iotsecurity/locations/devicegroups/devices"
| extend TimeFirstSeen=properties.firstSeen
| where TimeFirstSeen > ago(1d)
| extend DeviceName=properties.deviceName
| extend Site=properties.sensor.site
| extend Sensor=properties.sensor.name
| extend IPv4=properties.nics.[0].ipv4Address
| where properties.deviceDataSource=='OtSensor'
| project TimeFirstSeen, Site, Sensor, DeviceName, IPv4
```

**Summarize alerts by Purdue level**

```kusto
iotsecurityresources
    | where type == "microsoft.iotsecurity/locations/devicegroups/alerts"
    | project 
        resourceId = id,
        affectedResource = tostring(properties.extendedProperties.DeviceResourceIds),
        id = properties.systemAlertId
    | join kind=leftouter (
        iotsecurityresources | where type == "microsoft.iotsecurity/locations/devicegroups/devices" 
        | project 
            sensor = properties.sensor.name,
            zone = properties.sensor.zone,
            site = properties.sensor.site,
            deviceProperties=properties,
            affectedResource = tostring(id)
    ) on affectedResource
    | project-away affectedResource1
    | where deviceProperties.deviceDataSource == 'OtSensor'
    | summarize Alerts=count() by tostring(deviceProperties.purdueLevel)
```
