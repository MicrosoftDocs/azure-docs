# Validate an OT sensor software installation

This article is one in a series of articles describing the [deployment path](../ot-deploy/ot-deploy-path.md) for OT monitoring with Microsoft Defender for IoT.

:::image type="content" source="../media/deployment-paths/progress-deploy-your-sensors.png" alt-text="Diagram of a progress bar with Deploy your sensors highlighted." border="false" lightbox="../media/deployment-paths/progress-deploy-your-sensors.png":::

After you've installed OT software on your [OT sensors](install-software-ot-sensor.md), test your system to make sure that processes are running correctly. The same validation process applies to all appliance types.

System health validations are supported via UI or CLI and are available for the default, privileged *admin* user.

If you're using pre-configured appliances, continue directly with [activating and setting up your OT network sensor](activate-deploy-sensor.md) instead.

## Prerequisites

The procedures in this article assume that you've just installed Defender for IoT software on an OT network sensor.

For more information, see [Install OT monitoring software on OT sensors](install-software-ot-sensor.md).

This step is performed by your deployment teams.

## General tests

After installing OT monitoring software, make sure to run the following tests:

- **Sanity test**: Verify that the system is running.

- **Version**: Verify that the version is correct.

- **ifconfig**: Verify that all the input interfaces configured during the installation process are running.

## Gateway checks

Use the `route` command to show the gateway's IP address. For example:

``` CLI
<root@xsense:/# route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         172.18.0.1      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
172.18.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 eth0
>
```

Use the `arp -a` command to verify that there's a binding between the MAC address and the IP address of the default gateway. For example:

``` CLI
<root@xsense:/# arp -a
cusalvtecca101-gi0-02-2851.network.microsoft.com (172.18.0.1) at 02:42:b0:3a:e8:b5 [ether] on eth0
mariadb_22.2.6.27-r-c64cbca.iot_network_22.2.6.27-r-c64cbca (172.18.0.5) at 02:42:ac:12:00:05 [ether] on eth0
redis_22.2.6.27-r-c64cbca.iot_network_22.2.6.27-r-c64cbca (172.18.0.3) at 02:42:ac:12:00:03 [ether] on eth0
>
```

## DNS checks

Use the `cat /etc/resolv.conf` command to find the IP address that's configured for DNS traffic. For example:

``` CLI
<root@xsense:/# cat /etc/resolv.conf
search reddog.microsoft.com
nameserver 127.0.0.11
options ndots:0
>
```

Use the `host` command to resolve an FQDN. For example:

``` CLI
<root@xsense:/# host www.apple.com
www.apple.com is an alias for www.apple.com.edgekey.net.
www.apple.com.edgekey.net is an alias for www.apple.com.edgekey.net.globalredir.akadns.net.
www.apple.com.edgekey.net.globalredir.akadns.net is an alias for e6858.dscx.akamaiedge.net.
e6858.dscx.akamaiedge.net has address 72.246.148.202
e6858.dscx.akamaiedge.net has IPv6 address 2a02:26f0:5700:1b4::1aca
e6858.dscx.akamaiedge.net has IPv6 address 2a02:26f0:5700:182::1aca
>
```

## Firewall checks

Use the `wget` command to verify that port 443 is open for communication. For example:

``` CLI
<root@xsense:/# wget https://www.apple.com
--2022-11-09 11:21:15--  https://www.apple.com/
Resolving www.apple.com (www.apple.com)... 72.246.148.202, 2a02:26f0:5700:1b4::1aca, 2a02:26f0:5700:182::1aca
Connecting to www.apple.com (www.apple.com)|72.246.148.202|:443... connected.
