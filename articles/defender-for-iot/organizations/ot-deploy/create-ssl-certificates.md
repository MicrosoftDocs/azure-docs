# Create SSL/TLS certificates for OT appliances

This article is one in a series of articles describing the [deployment path](../ot-deploy/ot-deploy-path.md) for OT monitoring with Microsoft Defender for IoT, and describes how to create CA-signed certificates to use with Defender for IoT on-premises OT sensor appliances.

Each certificate authority (CA)-signed certificate must have both a `.key` file and a `.crt` file, which are uploaded to Defender for IoT appliances after the first sign-in. While some organizations may also require a `.pem` file, a `.pem` file isn't required for Defender for IoT.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must create a unique certificate for each Defender for IoT appliance, where each certificate meets required criteria.

## Prerequisites

To perform the procedures described in this article, make sure that you have a security, PKI or certificate specialist available to oversee the certificate creation.

Make sure that you've also familiarized yourself with [SSL/TLS certificate requirements for Defender for IoT](../best-practices/certificate-requirements.md).

## Create a CA-signed SSL/TLS certificate

We recommend that you always use CA-signed certificates on production environments, and only use [self-signed certificates](#self-signed-certificates) on testing environments.

Use a certificate management platform, such as an automated PKI management platform, to create a certificate that meets Defender for IoT requirements.

If you don't have an application that can automatically create certificates, consult a security, PKI, or other qualified certificate lead for help. You can also convert existing certificate files if you don't want to create new ones.

Make sure to create a unique certificate for each Defender for IoT appliance, where each certificate meets required [parameter criteria](../best-practices/certificate-requirements.md).

**For example**:

1. Open the downloaded certificate file and select the **Details** tab > **Copy to file** to run the **Certificate Export Wizard**.

1. In the **Certificate Export Wizard**, select **Next** > **DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)** > and then select **Next** again.

1. In the **File to Export** screen, select **Browse**, choose a location to store the certificate, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Finish** to export the certificate.

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to convert existing files types to supported types.

Verify that the certificate meets [certificate file requirements](../best-practices/certificate-requirements.md#crt-file-requirements), and then [test the certificate](#test-your-ssltls-certificates) file you created when you're done.

If you aren't using certificate validation, remove the CRL URL reference in the certificate. For more information, see [certificate file requirements](../best-practices/certificate-requirements.md#crt-file-requirements).

> [!TIP]
> (Optional) Create a certificate chain, which is a `.pem` file that contains the certificates of all the certificate authorities in the chain of trust that led to your certificate.

## Verify CRL server access

If your organization validates certificates, your Defender for IoT appliances must be able to access the CRL server defined by the certificate.  By default, certificates access the CRL server URL via HTTP port 80. However, some organizational security policies block access to this port.

If your appliances can't access your CRL server on port 80, you can use one of the following workarounds:

- **Define another URL and port in the certificate**:

  - The URL you define must be configured as `http: //` and not `https://`
  - Make sure that the destination CRL server can listen on the port you define

- **Use a proxy server that can access the CRL on port 80**

    For more information, see [Forward OT alert information].

If validation fails, communication between the relevant components is halted and a validation error is presented in the console.

## Import the SSL/TLS certificate to a trusted store

After creating your certificate, import it to a trusted storage location. For example:

1. Open the security certificate file and, in the **General** tab, select **Install Certificate** to start the **Certificate Import Wizard**.

1. In **Store Location**, select **Local Machine**, then select **Next**.

1. If a **User Allow Control** prompt appears, select **Yes** to allow the app to make changes to your device.

1. In the **Certificate Store** screen, select **Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate**, then select **Next**.

1. Select **Place all certificates in the following store**, then **Browse**, and then select the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** store. When you're done, select **Next**. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-deploy-certificates/certificate-store-trusted-root.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the certificate store screen where you can browse to the trusted root folder." lightbox="../media/how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor/certificate-store-trusted-root.png":::

1. Select **Finish** to complete the import.

## Test your SSL/TLS certificates

Use the following procedures to test certificates before deploying them to your Defender for IoT appliances.

### Check your certificate against a sample

Use the following sample certificate to compare to the certificate you've created, making sure that the same fields exist in the same order.

``` Sample SSL certificate
Bag Attributes: <No Attributes>
subject=C = US, S = Illinois, L = Springfield, O = Contoso Ltd, OU= Contoso Labs, CN= sensor.contoso.com, E 
= support@contoso.com
issuer C=US, S = Illinois, L = Springfield, O = Contoso Ltd, OU= Contoso Labs, CN= Cert-ssl-root-da2e22f7-24af-4398-be51-
e4e11f006383, E = support@contoso.com

### Test certificates without a `.csr` or private key file

If you want to check the information within the certificate `.csr` file or private key file, use the following CLI commands:

- **Check a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**: Run `openssl req -text -noout -verify -in CSR.csr`
- **Check a private key**: Run  `openssl rsa -in privateKey.key -check`
- **Check a certificate**: Run `openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout`

If these tests fail, review [certificate file requirements](../best-practices/certificate-requirements.md#crt-file-requirements) to verify that your file parameters are accurate, or consult your certificate specialist.

### Validate the certificate's common name

1. To view the certificate's common name, open the certificate file and select the Details tab, and then select the **Subject** field.

    The certificate's common name appears next to **CN**.

1. Sign-in to your sensor console without a secure connection. In the **Your connection isn't private** warning screen, you might see a **NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID** error message.

1. Select the error message to expand it, and then copy the string next to **Subject**. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-deploy-certificates/connection-is-not-private-subject.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the connection isn't private screen with the details expanded." lightbox="../media/how-to-deploy-certificates/connection-is-not-private-subject.png":::

    The subject string should match the **CN** string in the security certificate's details.

1. In your local file explorer, browse to the hosts file, such as at **This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Windows > System32 > drivers > etc**, and open the **hosts** file.

1. In the hosts file, add in a line at the end of document with the sensor's IP address and the SSL certificate's common name that you copied in the previous steps. When you're done, save the changes. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-deploy-certificates/hosts-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the hosts file." lightbox="../media/how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor/hosts-file.png":::

### Self-signed certificates

Self-signed certificates are available for use in testing environments after installing Defender for IoT OT monitoring software. For more information, see:

- [Create and deploy self-signed certificates on OT sensors](../how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#manage-ssltls-certificates)
