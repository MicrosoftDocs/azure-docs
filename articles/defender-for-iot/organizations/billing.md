# Defender for IoT subscription billing

As you plan your Microsoft Defender for IoT deployment, you typically want to understand the Defender for IoT pricing plans and billing models so you can optimize your costs.

## Free trial

If you would like to evaluate Defender for IoT, you can use a trial commitment.

The trial is valid for 30 days and supports 1,000 *committed devices*, which are the approximate number of devices that will be monitored in your enterprise.

- **For OT networks**, use a trial to deploy one or more Defender for IoT sensors on your network to monitor traffic, analyze data, generate alerts, learn about network risks and vulnerabilities, and more.

- **For Enterprise IoT networks**, use a trial to view alerts, recommendations, and vulnerabilities in Microsoft 365.

## Defender for IoT committed devices

When onboarding or editing a monthly or annual Defender for IoT plan, we recommend that you have a sense of how many devices you would like to monitor.

You're billed based on the number of committed devices associated with each subscription.

## Billing cycles and changes in your plans

Billing cycles for Microsoft Defender for IoT follow each a calendar month. Changes you make to Defender for IoT plans are implemented one hour after confirming the updated, and are reflected in your monthly bill.

Canceling a Defender for IoT plan from your Azure subscription also takes effect one hour after canceling the plan.

Your enterprise may have more than one paying entity. If so, you can onboard, edit, or cancel a plan for more than one subscription.
