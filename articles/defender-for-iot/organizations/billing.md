# Defender for IoT subscription billing

As you plan your Microsoft Defender for IoT deployment, you typically want to understand the Defender for IoT pricing plans and billing models so you can optimize your costs.

OT monitoring is billed using site-based licenses, where each license applies to an individual site, based on the site size. A site is a physical location, such as a facility, campus, office building, hospital, rig, and so on. Each site can contain any number of network sensors, all which monitor devices detected in connected networks.

Enterprise IoT monitoring is billed based on the number of devices covered by your plan.

## Free trial

If you would like to evaluate Defender for IoT, you can use a trial license:

- **For OT networks**, use a trial to deploy one or more Defender for IoT sensors on your network to monitor traffic, analyze data, generate alerts, learn about network risks and vulnerabilities, and more. An OT trial supports a **Large** site license for 60 days. For more information, see [Start a Microsoft Defender for IoT trial](getting-started.md).

- **For Enterprise IoT networks**, use a 30-day trial to view alerts, recommendations, and vulnerabilities in Microsoft 365. An Enterprise IoT trial is not limited to a specific number of devices. For more information, see [Enable Enterprise IoT security with Defender for Endpoint](eiot-defender-for-endpoint.md).

## Defender for IoT devices

When purchasing a Defender for IoT license for an OT plan, or when onboarding or editing a monthly Enterprise IoT plan, we recommend that you have a sense of how many devices you'll want to cover.

- **OT monitoring**: Purchase a license for each site that you're planning to monitor. License fees differ based on the site size, each which covers a different number of devices.

- **Enterprise IoT monitoring**: Purchase a price plan based on the number of devices you want to monitor.
