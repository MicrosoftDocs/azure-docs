# Microsoft Defender for IoT alert reference

This article provides a reference of the [alerts](how-to-manage-cloud-alerts.md) that are generated by Microsoft Defender for IoT network sensors, including a list of all alert types and descriptions. You might use this reference to [map alerts into playbooks](iot-advanced-threat-monitoring.md#automate-response-to-defender-for-iot-alerts), [define forwarding rules](how-to-forward-alert-information-to-partners.md) on an OT network sensor, or other custom activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Alerts** page in the Azure portal is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## OT alerts turned off by default

Several alerts are turned off by default, as indicated by asterisks (*) in the tables below. OT sensor **Admin** users can enable or disable alerts from the **Support** page on a specific OT network sensor.

If you turn off alerts that are referenced in other places, such as [alert forwarding rules](how-to-forward-alert-information-to-partners.md), make sure to update those references as needed.

## Alert severities

Defender for IoT alerts use the following severity levels:

| Azure portal  | OT sensor  | Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **High**     | **Critical**        | Indicates a malicious attack that should be handled immediately.        |
| **Medium**     | **Major**        | Indicates a security threat that's important to address.        |
| **Low**     | **Minor**, **Warning**        | Indicates some deviation from the baseline behavior that might contain a security threat, or contains no security threats.        |

Alert severities on this page are listed by the severity as shown in the Azure portal.

## Supported alert types

| Alert type | Description |
|-|-|
| **Policy violation alerts** | Triggered when the Policy Violation engine detects a deviation from traffic previously learned. For example: <br /> - A new device is detected.  <br /> - A new configuration is detected on a device. <br /> - A device not defined as a programming device carries out a programming change. <br /> - A firmware version changed. |
| **Protocol violation alerts** | Triggered when the Protocol Violation engine detects packet structures or field values that don't comply with the protocol specification. |
| **Operational alerts** | Triggered when the Operational engine detects network operational incidents or a device malfunctioning. For example, a network device was stopped through a Stop PLC command, or an interface on a sensor stopped monitoring traffic. |
| **Malware alerts** | Triggered when the Malware engine detects malicious network activity. For example, the engine detects a known attack such as Conficker. |
| **Anomaly alerts** | Triggered when the Anomaly engine detects a deviation. For example, a device is performing network scans but isn't defined as a scanning device. |

## Supported alert categories

Each alert has one of the following categories:

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      - Abnormal Communication Behavior
      - Abnormal HTTP Communication Behavior
      - Authentication
