# Microsoft Defender for IoT alert reference

This article provides a reference of the [alerts](how-to-manage-cloud-alerts.md) that are generated by Microsoft Defender for IoT network sensors, including a list of all alert types and descriptions. The reference also shows which alerts can be triaged as learnable or not, for more information on the learnable status, see [Alert statuses and triaging options](alerts.md#alert-statuses-and-triaging-options). You might use this reference to [map alerts into playbooks](iot-advanced-threat-monitoring.md#automate-response-to-defender-for-iot-alerts), [define forwarding rules](how-to-forward-alert-information-to-partners.md) on an Operational Technology (OT) network sensor, or other custom activity.

## OT alerts turned off by default

Several alerts are turned off by default, as indicated by asterisks (*) in the tables below. OT sensor **Admin** users can enable or disable alerts from the **Support** page on a specific OT network sensor.

If you turn off alerts that are referenced in other places, such as [alert forwarding rules](how-to-forward-alert-information-to-partners.md), make sure to update those references as needed.

## Alert severities

Defender for IoT alerts use the following severity levels:

| Azure portal  | OT sensor  | Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **High**     | **Critical**        | Indicates a malicious attack that should be handled immediately.        |
| **Medium**     | **Major**        | Indicates a security threat that's important to address.        |
| **Low**     | **Minor**, **Warning**        | Indicates some deviation from the baseline behavior that might contain a security threat, or contains no security threats.        |

Alert severities on this page list the severity as shown in the Azure portal.

## Supported alert types

| Alert type | Description |
|-|-|
| **Policy violation alerts** | Triggered when the Policy Violation engine detects a deviation from traffic previously learned. For example: <br /> - A new device is detected.  <br /> - A new configuration is detected on a device. <br /> - A device not defined as a programming device carries out a programming change. <br /> - A firmware version changed. |
| **Protocol violation alerts** | Triggered when the Protocol Violation engine detects packet structures or field values that don't comply with the protocol specification. |
| **Operational alerts** | Triggered when the Operational engine detects network operational incidents or a device malfunctioning. For example, a network device was stopped through a Stop PLC command, or an interface on a sensor stopped monitoring traffic. |
| **Malware alerts** | Triggered when the Malware engine detects malicious network activity. For example, the engine detects a known attack such as Conficker. |
| **Anomaly alerts** | Triggered when the Anomaly engine detects a deviation. For example, a device is performing network scans but isn't defined as a scanning device. |

Defender for IoT's alert detection policy steers the different alert engines to trigger alerts based on business impact and network context,â€¯and reduce low-value IT related alerts. For more information, see [Focused alerts in OT/IT environments](alerts.md#focused-alerts-in-otit-environments).

## Supported alert categories

Each alert has one of the following categories:

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      - Abnormal Communication Behavior
      - Abnormal HTTP Communication Behavior
      - Authentication
      - Backup
      - Bandwidth Anomalies
      - Buffer overflow
      - Command Failures
      - Configuration changes
      - Custom Alerts

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Policy engine alerts

Policy engine alerts describe detected deviations from learned baseline behavior.

The policy engine alerts table contains the **Aggregated** item to indicate that multiple alerts of this type can be grouped together and listed only once in the Alerts page to reduce alert fatigue. For more information, see [aggregated alerts](alerts.md#aggregating-alert-violations).
