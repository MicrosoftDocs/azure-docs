Defender for IoT can discover all devices, of all types, across all environments. Devices are listed in the Defender for IoT **Device inventory** pages based on a unique IP and MAC address coupling.

Defender for IoT identifies single and unique devices as follows:

|Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Identified as individual devices**     |    Devices identified as *individual* devices include:<br>**IT, OT, or IoT devices with one or more NICs**, including network infrastructure devices such as switches and routers<br><br>**Note**: A device with modules or backplane components, such as racks or slots, is counted as a single device, including all modules or backplane components.|
|**Not identified as individual devices**     | The following items *aren't* considered as individual devices, and do not count against your license:<br><br>- **Public internet IP addresses** <br>- **Multi-cast groups**<br>- **Broadcast groups**<br>- **Inactive devices**<br><br> Network-monitored devices are marked as *inactive* when there's no network activity detected within a specified time:<br><br> In **OT networks**, no network activity is detected for more than 60 days.<br> **Note**: Endpoints already managed by Defender for Endpoint are not considered as separate devices by Defender for IoT.  |
