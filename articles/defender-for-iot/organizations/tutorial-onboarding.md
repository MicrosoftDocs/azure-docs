# Tutorial: Azure Defender for IoT trial setup

This tutorial will help you learn how to onboard to Azure Defender for IoT with a virtual sensor, on a virtual machine, with a trial subscription of Azure Defender for IoT. This tutorial will show you the optimal setup for someone who wishes to test Azure Defender for IoT, before signing up, and incorporating it into their environment.

By using virtual environments, along with the software needed to create a sensor, Defender for IoT allows you to:

- Use passive, agentless network monitoring to gain a complete inventory of all your IoT, and OT devices, their details, and how they communicate, with zero effect on the IoT, and OT network.

- Identify risks and vulnerabilities in your IoT, and OT environment. For example, identify unpatched devices, open ports, unauthorized applications, and unauthorized connections. You can also identify changes to device configurations, PLC code, and firmware.

- Detect anomalous or unauthorized activities with specialized IoT, and OT-aware threat intelligence and behavioral analytics. You can even detect advanced threats missed by static IOCs, like zero-day malware, fileless malware, and living-off-the-land tactics.

- Integrate into Azure Sentinel for a bird's-eye view of your entire organization. Implement unified IoT, and OT security governance with integration into your existing workflows, including third-party tools like Splunk, IBM QRadar, and ServiceNow.

## Configure a SPAN port

A virtual switch does not have mirroring capabilities. However, you can use promiscuous mode in a virtual switch environment. Promiscuous mode  is a mode of operation, as well as a security, monitoring and administration technique, that is defined at the virtual switch, or portgroup level. By default, Promiscuous mode is disabled. When Promiscuous mode is enabled the virtual machine’s network interfaces that are in the same portgroup will use the Promiscuous mode to view all network traffic that goes through that virtual switch. You can implement a workaround with either ESXi, or Hyper-V.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-onboarding/purdue-model.png" alt-text="A screenshot of where in your architecture the sensor should be placed.":::

### Configure a SPAN port with ESXi

## Onboard, and activate the virtual sensor

Before you can start using your Defender for IoT sensor, you will need to onboard the created virtual sensor to your Azure subscription, and download the virtual sensor's activation file to activate the sensor.

### Onboard the virtual sensor

**To onboard the virtual sensor:**

1. Go to the **Welcome** page in the [Defender for IoT portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started).

1. Select **Onboard sensor**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-onboarding/onboard-a-sensor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting to onboard the sensor to start the onboarding process for your sensor.":::

1. Enter a name for the sensor.

   We recommend that you include the IP address of the sensor as part of the name, or use an easily identifiable name. Naming your sensor in this way will ensure easier tracking.

1. Select a subscription from the drop-down menu.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-onboarding/name-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot of entering a meaningful name, and connect your sensor to a subscription.":::

1. Choose a sensor connection mode by using the **Cloud connected** toggle. If the toggle is on, the sensor is cloud connected. If the toggle is off, the sensor is locally managed.

   - **Cloud-connected sensors**: Information that the sensor detects is displayed in the sensor console. Alert information is delivered through an IoT hub and can be shared with other Azure services, such as Azure Sentinel. In addition, threat intelligence packages can be pushed from the Azure Defender for IoT portal to sensors. Conversely when, the sensor is not cloud connected, you must download  threat intelligence packages and then upload them to your enterprise sensors. To allow Defender for IoT to push packages to sensors, enable the **Automatic Threat Intelligence Updates** toggle. For more information, see [Threat intelligence research and packages](how-to-work-with-threat-intelligence-packages.md).

      For cloud connected sensors, the name defined during onboarding is the name that appears in the sensor console. You can't change this name from the console directly. For locally managed sensors, the name applied during onboarding will be stored in Azure but can be updated in the sensor console.

   - **Locally managed sensors**: Information that sensors detect is displayed in the sensor console. If you're working in an air-gapped network and want a unified view of all information detected by multiple locally managed sensors, work with the on-premises management console.

1. Select a site to associate your sensor to within an IoT Hub. The IoT Hub will serve as a gateway between this sensor and Azure Defender for IoT. Define the display name, and zone. You can also add descriptive tags. The display name, zone, and tags are descriptive entries on the [View onboarded sensors](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#view-onboarded-sensors).

1. Select **Register**.

### Download the sensor activation file

Once registration is complete for the sensor, you will be able to download an activation file for the sensor. The sensor activation file contains instructions about the management mode of the sensor. The activation file you download, will be unique for each sensor that you deploy. The user who signs in to the sensor console for the first time, will uploads the activation file to the sensor.

**To download an activation file:**

1. On the **Onboard Sensor** page, select **Register**

1. Select **download activation file**.

1. Make the file accessible to the user who's signing in to the sensor console for the first time.

### Sign in and activate the sensor
