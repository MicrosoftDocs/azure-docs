## Nuvo 5006LP sensor installation

This section describes how to install OT sensor software on the Nuvo 5006LP appliance. Before installing the OT sensor software, you must adjust the appliance's BIOS configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> Installation procedures are only relevant if you need to re-install software on a preconfigured device, or if you buy your own hardware and configure the appliance yourself.
>

### Prerequisites

Before installing OT sensor software, or updating the BIOS configuration, make sure that the operating system is installed on the appliance.

### Configure the Nuvo 5006LP BIOS

This procedure describes how to update the Nuvo 5006LP BIOS configuration for your OT sensor deployment.

**To configure the Nuvo 5006LP BIOS**:

1. Power on the appliance.

1. Press **F2** to enter the BIOS configuration.

1. Go to **Power** and change the **Power On after Power Failure** setting to **S0-Power On**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-install-components/nuvo-power-on.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting your Nuvo 5006 to power on after a power failure.":::

1. Go to **Boot** and ensure that **PXE Boot to LAN** is set to **Disabled**.

1. Press **F10** to save, and then select **Exit**.

### Install OT sensor software on the Nuvo 5006LP

This procedure describes how to install OT sensor software on the Nuvo 5006LP. The installation takes approximately 20 minutes. After the installation is complete, the system restarts several times.

**To install OT sensor software**:

1. Connect an external CD or disk-on-key that contains the sensor software you downloaded from the Azure portal.

1. Boot the appliance.

1. Select **English**.

1. Select **XSENSE-RELEASE-\<version> Office...**.

1. Define the appliance architecture, and network properties as follows:

    | Parameter | Configuration |
    | ----------| ------------- |
    | **Hardware profile** | Select **office**. |
    | **Management interface** | **eth0** |
    | **Management network IP address** | **IP address provided by the customer** |
    | **Management subnet mask** | **IP address provided by the customer** |
    | **DNS** | **IP address provided by the customer** |
    | **Default gateway IP address** | **0.0.0.0** |
    | **Input interface** | The list of input interfaces is generated for you by the system. <br />To mirror the input interfaces, copy all the items presented in the list with a comma separator. |
    | **Bridge interface** | - |

    For example:

1. Accept the settings and continue by entering `Y`.

After approximately 10 minutes, sign-in credentials are automatically generated. Save the username and passwords; you'll need these credentials to access the platform the first time you use it.

## Next steps

Continue understanding system requirements for physical or virtual appliances. For more information, see [Which appliances do I need?](../ot-appliance-sizing.md).
