To purchase a preconfigured appliance, contact Arrow at: [hardware.sales@arrow.com](mailto:hardware.sales@arrow.com?cc=DIoTHardwarePurchase@microsoft.com&subject=Information%20about%20Microsoft%20Defender%20for%20IoT%20pre-configured%20appliances&body=Dear%20Arrow%20Representative,%0D%0DOur%20organization%20is%20interested%20in%20receiving%20quotes%20for%20Microsoft%20Defender%20for%20IoT%20appliances%20as%20well%20as%20fulfillment%20options.%0D%0DThe%20purpose%20of%20this%20communication%20is%20to%20inform%20you%20of%20a%20project%20which%20involves%20[NUMBER]%20sites%20and%20[NUMBER]%20sensors%20for%20[ORGANIZATION%20NAME].%20Having%20reviewed%20potential%20appliances%20suitable%20for%20our%20project,%20we%20would%20like%20to%20obtain%20more%20information%20about:%20___________%0D%0D%0DI%20would%20appreciate%20being%20contacted%20by%20an%20Arrow%20representative%20to%20receive%20a%20quote%20for%20the%20items%20mentioned%20above.%0DI%20understand%20the%20quote%20and%20appliance%20delivery%20shall%20be%20in%20accordance%20with%20the%20relevant%20Arrow%20terms%20and%20conditions%20for%20Microsoft%20Defender%20for%20IoT%20pre-configured%20appliances.%0D%0D%0DBest%20Regards,%0D%0D%0D%0D%0D%0D//////////////////////////////%20%0D/////////%20Replace%20[NUMBER]%20with%20appropriate%20values%20related%20to%20your%20request.%0D/////////%20Replace%20[ORGANIZATION%20NAME]%20with%20the%20name%20of%20the%20organization%20you%20represent.%0D//////////////////////////////%0D%0D).

## Advantages of preconfigured appliances

Preconfigured physical appliances have been validated for Defender for IoT OT system monitoring, and have the following advantages over installing your own software:

- **Performance** over the total assets monitored
- **Compatibility** with new Defender for IoT releases, with validations for upgrades and driver support
- **Stability**, validated physical appliances undergo traffic monitoring and packet loss tests
- **In-lab experience**, Microsoft support teams train using validated physical appliances and have a working knowledge of the hardware
- **Availability**, components are selected to offer long-term worldwide availability

> [!NOTE]
> The performance, capacity, and activity of an OT/IoT network may vary depending on its size, capacity, protocols distribution, and overall activity. For deployments, it is important to factor in raw network speed, the size of the network to monitor, and application configuration. The selection of processors, memory, and network cards is heavily influenced by these deployment configurations. The amount of space needed on your disk will differ depending on how long you store data, and the amount and type of data you store. <br><br>
> *Performance values are presented as upper thresholds under the assumption of intermittent traffic profiles, such as those found in OT/IoT systems and machine-to-machine communication networks.*
