# Pre-configured physical appliances for OT monitoring

This article provides a catalog of the pre-configured appliances available for Microsoft Defender for IoT OT sensors and on-premises management consoles.

Use the links in the tables below to jump to articles with more details about each appliance.

Microsoft has partnered with [Arrow Electronics](https://www.arrow.com/) to provide pre-configured sensors. To purchase a pre-configured sensor, contact Arrow at: [hardware.sales@arrow.com](mailto:hardware.sales@arrow.com?cc=DIoTHardwarePurchase@microsoft.com&subject=Information%20about%20Microsoft%20Defender%20for%20IoT%20pre-configured%20appliances&body=Dear%20Arrow%20Representative,%0D%0DOur%20organization%20is%20interested%20in%20receiving%20quotes%20for%20Microsoft%20Defender%20for%20IoT%20appliances%20as%20well%20as%20fulfillment%20options.%0D%0DThe%20purpose%20of%20this%20communication%20is%20to%20inform%20you%20of%20a%20project%20which%20involves%20[NUMBER]%20sites%20and%20[NUMBER]%20sensors%20for%20[ORGANIZATION%20NAME].%20Having%20reviewed%20potential%20appliances%20suitable%20for%20our%20project,%20we%20would%20like%20to%20obtain%20more%20information%20about:%20___________%0D%0D%0DTo%20receive%20a%20quote%20for%20the%20items%20mentioned%20above,%20I%20would%20appreciate%20being%20contacted%20by%20an%20Arrow%20representative.%0DI%20understand%20the%20quote%20and%20appliance%20delivery%20shall%20be%20in%20accordance%20with%20the%20relevant%20Arrow%20terms%20and%20conditions%20for%20Microsoft%20Defender%20for%20IoT%20pre-configured%20appliances.%0D%0D%0DBest%20Regards,%0D%0D%0D%0D%0D%0D//////////////////////////////%20%0D/////////%20Replace%20[NUMBER]%20with%20appropriate%20values%20related%20to%20your%20request.%0D/////////%20Replace%20[ORGANIZATION%20NAME]%20with%20the%20name%20of%20the%20organization%20you%20represent.%0D//////////////////////////////%0D%0D).

## Advantages of pre-configured appliances

Pre-configured physical appliances have been validated for Defender for IoT OT system monitoring, and have the following advantages over installing your own software:

- **Performance** over the total assets monitored
- **Compatibility** with new Defender for IoT releases, with validations for upgrades and driver support
- **Stability**, validated physical appliances undergo traffic monitoring and packet loss tests
- **In-lab experience**, Microsoft support teams train using validated physical appliances and have a working knowledge of the hardware
- **Availability**, components are selected to offer long-term worldwide availability
