# Vulnerability management API reference for OT monitoring sensors

This article lists the vulnerability management REST APIs supported for Microsoft Defender for IoT OT monitoring sensors.

The data included in the API responses includes the same information as if you generated a vulnerability report from the on-premises management console.

## devices (Retrieve device vulnerability information)

Use this API to request vulnerability assessment results for each device.

**URI**: `/api/v1/reports/vulnerabilities/devices`

### GET

# [Request](#tab/devices-request)

This API is called without any request parameters.

# [Response](#tab/devices-response)

**Type**: JSON

Array of JSON objects that represent assessed devices and their reported vulnerabilities.

Devices that are found to have no vulnerabilities are not included in the result response.

## mitigation (Retrieve mitigation steps)

Use this API to request a mitigation assessment. This assessment provides recommended steps for mitigating detected vulnerabilities. It's based on general network and system information and not on a specific device evaluation.

**URI**: `/api/v1/reports/vulnerabilities/mitigation`

### GET

# [Request](#tab/mitigation-request)

This API is called without any request parameters.

# [Response](#tab/mitigation-response)

**Type**: JSON

JSON object that represents recommended mitigation steps.

#### Response fields

| Field name | Type | Nullable | List of values |
|--|--|--|
| **notifications** | JSON array of strings | Not nullable | Recommended mitigation steps for detected vulnerabilities |
| **mitigation** | JSON array | Not nullable | [mitigation](#mitigation-fields) objects |

#### mitigation fields

| Field name | Type | Nullable | List of values |
|--|--|--|
| **content** | String | Not nullable | Recommended mitigation steps for detected vulnerabilities  |
| **scoreImprovement** | Integer | Nullable | Expected percentage of security improvement after mitigation steps are taken.  |
| **details** | Table | Nullable | A table listing mitigation recommendations, such as would be generated in the **Risk assessment** report. Each recommendation includes details about possible security impact if the action is performed and more. For more information, see [Risk mitigation](../how-to-create-risk-assessment-reports.md#create-risk-assessment-reports). |

> [!NOTE]
> You might have multiple mitigation steps, with some returned in the `notifications` field, and others returned in the `mitigation` field. Items with `scoreImprovement` and `details` data is returned only in the `mitigation` field. Items without `scoreImprovement` and `details` data is returned only in the `notifications` field.
