# Vulnerability management in the Azure portal

With vulnerability management, Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Azure portal provides extended coverage for Operational Technology (OT) networks, which identify security vulnerabilities in OT network devices.

The OT security administrator views vulnerability data, such as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) details and a CVSS score, in the device inventory, workbooks and security recommendations for each device. The administrator can then proactively manage network exposure based on the vulnerability details and recommended remediation actions.

Defender for IoT provides vulnerability coverage for [supported OT vendors](resources-manage-proprietary-protocols.md) where Defender for IoT can detect firmware models and firmware versions. Vulnerability data is based on the repository of standards-based vulnerability data documented in the US government National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and is displayed with its CVE details and description.

## Vulnerability management capabilities

The key vulnerability management capabilities are:

| Capability | Description |
| --- | ---|
| [Device inventory](how-to-manage-device-inventory-for-organizations.md#view-full-device-details)|  The Device inventory displays the current vulnerabilities detected on each device.  |
| [Workbooks](workbooks.md#view-workbooks) | Data about the vulnerabilities detected on OT devices is available using the **Vulnerabilities** workbook. Workbooks are pages created by Microsoft and provided out-of-the-box, which contain graphs and charts to display your data and help you analyze the data more effectively. |
| [Security Recommendations](recommendations.md#supported-security-recommendations) | OT devices listed in the Device inventory contain suggested security recommendations for any critically severe vulnerability detected for top OT vendors. The vulnerability recommendation is named **Secure your vulnerable `vendor` devices**.<br><br>The recommendations are based on the device vendor or Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and list the remediation steps needed to improve the security of the network. |
