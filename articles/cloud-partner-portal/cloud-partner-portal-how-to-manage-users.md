# Managing Users

Cloud partner portal provides you the capability to add users with role based access. This helps manage access and permissions to the offers while multiple people are working on it. Please follow the below steps to add users and assign roles to contribute to your offer publishing.

### Step 1. Click on the ‘Users’ tab on left side navigation pane to add users and assign roles.

### Step 3. Add Email and Assign Roles. You can add the new user as an ‘owner’ or ‘contributor’. You will find more details about the roles and its permissions in the below table.

You can add the email address of your teammates who will be working on publishing the offer. MSA (Microsoft Account [Outlook, Hotmail and Live]) and Org ID’s are supported. 
o	It is recommended to add a security group to avoid the situation where the individual working on the offer leaves the organization. 
o	Ensure that email ids provided on the cloud partner portal are monitored for any communication from Microsoft.
