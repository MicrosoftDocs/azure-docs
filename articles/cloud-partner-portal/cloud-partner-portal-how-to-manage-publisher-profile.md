# Managing ‘Azure Marketplace’ and ‘Appsource’ Publisher Profile

This document is a walk through to view and manage your registered publisher profile. By this time, you must have completed the steps to become an Azure Marketplace and Appsource Publisher. Publisher profile gets registered on **[Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/)** post the approval of your ‘Become a partner request’. Your publisher profile will be applicable to all the offers and SKUs published via your account used during partner registration. If you haven’t registered your company as a cloud partner for VM publishing click [here](http://createopportunity.azurewebsites.net/)

Your Publisher profile distinguishes your company in the Azure Marketplace and Appsource. A well-managed Publisher profile increase your visibility and help marketplace users to easily identify and choose the right offer.

**Publisher Profile**: It consists of Publisher ID, Display Name and Owner Email(s). 

> **Important:** Your publisher ID and registered owner email is not editable once you publish your first offer. You can view and edit (restricted to only updating the publisher display name) your publisher profile from the ‘Cloud Partner Portal’. 

> [!NOTE]  You can add users (contributors and owners) to your publishing profile from the ‘Users’ section on the left navigation pane on the  **[Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/).** 

**To view and manage your publisher profile, go to the ‘Publisher Profile’ tab in the ‘Top Right Menu Bar.**
