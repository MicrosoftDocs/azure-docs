# Feedback: Marketplace publishing and Cloud partner portal

Microsoft wants to make the Azure Marketplace, the AppSource publishing process, and the overall cloud partner portal experience as easy and as intuitive as possible. We’re looking to you to let us know if we hit the mark, or if we have things to work on. We'll triage and review all feedback, and we’ll always respect your privacy (so we’ll only contact you if we need more info). 

If you need immediate help, please contact [support](https://aka.ms/cloudpartnerportalsupport).

To let us know what you think, sign in to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) and click the smiley face in the top menu bar.
