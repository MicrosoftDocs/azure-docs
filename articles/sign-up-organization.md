<h1 id="signup">Sign up for Azure as an organization</h1>

[WACOM.INCLUDE [disclaimer](../includes/disclaimer.md)]

Until recently, you could only sign up for a new Microsoft Azure subscription using your Microsoft account (Windows Live ID). Azure now supports using either of the following two account methods to sign up:

* **Microsoft accounts** (created by you for personal use) - Provide access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook (Hotmail), Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox LIVE, or Office 365. Signing up for Outlook automatically creates a Microsoft account with an @Outlook.com address. After a Microsoft account is created, it can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure.

* **Work or school accounts** (issued by an admin for business/academic use) - Provide access to all small, medium, and enterprise business-level Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure, Windows Intune, or Office 365. When you sign up to one of these services as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Azure Active Directory to represent your organization.

	After this directory has been created, an admin can then create users and assign licenses to them based on which cloud service subscriptions they need access to, such as Azure.
