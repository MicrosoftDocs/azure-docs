## Access logs categories

Access logs categories for a network security perimeter are based on the results of access rules evaluation. The log categories chosen in the diagnostic settings are sent to the customer chosen storage location. The following are the descriptions for each of the access log categories including the modes in which they're applicable:

| **Log category** | **Description** | **Applicable to Modes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **NspPublicInboundPerimeterRulesAllowed** | Inbound access is allowed based on network security perimeter access rules. | Learning/Enforced |
| **NspPublicInboundPerimeterRulesDenied** | Public inbound access denied by network security perimeter. | Enforced |
| **NspPublicOutboundPerimeterRulesAllowed** | Outbound access is allowed based on network security perimeter access rules. | Learning/Enforced |
| **NspPublicOutboundPerimeterRulesDenied** | Public outbound access denied by network security perimeter. | Enforced |
| **NspOutboundAttempt** | Outbound attempt within network security perimeter. | Learning/Enforced |
| **NspIntraPerimeterInboundAllowed** | Inbound access within perimeter is allowed. | Learning/Enforced |
| **NspPublicInboundResourceRulesAllowed** | When network security perimeter rules deny, inbound access is allowed based on PaaS resource rules. | Learning |
| **NspPublicInboundResourceRulesDenied** | When network security perimeter rules deny, inbound access denied by PaaS resource rules. | Learning |
| **NspPublicOutboundResourceRulesAllowed** | When network security perimeter rules deny, outbound access allowed based on PaaS resource rules. | Learning |
| **NspPublicOutboundResourceRulesDenied** | When network security perimeter rules deny, outbound access denied by PaaS resource rules. | Learning |
| **NspPrivateInboundAllowed** | Private endpoint traffic is allowed. | Learning/Enforced |

## Logging destination options for access logs

> [!NOTE]
> When using Azure Monitor with a network security perimeter, the Log Analytics workspace to be associated with the network security perimeter needs to be located in one of the Azure Monitor supported regions. For more information on available regions, see [Regional limits for Network Security Perimeter](./network-security-perimeter-concepts.md#regional-limitations).
