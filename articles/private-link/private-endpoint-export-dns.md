# Export DNS records for a private endpoint by using the Azure portal

A private endpoint in Azure requires DNS records for name resolution of the endpoint. The DNS record resolves the private IP address of the endpoint for the configured resource. To export the DNS records of the endpoint, use the Azure Private Link Center in the portal.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A private endpoint configured in your subscription. For the example in this article, a private endpoint to an Azure web app is used. For more information on how to create a private endpoint for a web app, see [Tutorial: Connect to a web app using an Azure private endpoint](tutorial-private-endpoint-webapp-portal.md).

## Export endpoint DNS records

In this section, you sign in to the Azure portal and search for the Private Link Center.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Private Link**.

1. Select **Private link**.

1. In the Private Link Center, select **Private endpoints**.

1. In **Private endpoints**, select the endpoint for which you want to export the DNS records. Select **Download host file** to download the endpoint DNS records in a host file format.

1. The downloaded host file records look similar to this example:

    ```text
    # Exported from the Azure portal "2021-07-26 11:26:03Z"
    # Private IP    FQDN    Private Endpoint Id
