# Azure RBAC permissions for Azure Private Link

Access management for cloud resources is a critical function for any organization. Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) manages access and operations of Azure resources.

To deploy a private endpoint or private link service a user must have assigned a built-in role such as: 

* [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fprivate-link%2ftoc.json#owner)
* [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fprivate-link%2ftoc.json#contributor)
* [Network contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fprivate-link%2ftoc.json#network-contributor)

You can provide more granular access by creating a [custom role](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fprivate-link%2ftoc.json) with the permissions described in the following sections.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article lists the specific permissions to create a private endpoint or private link service. Ensure you add the specific permissions related to the service you would like to grant access through private link, such as Microsoft.SQL Contributor Role for Azure SQL. For more information about built-in roles, see [Role Based Access Control](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md).

Microsoft.Network and the specific resource provider you are deploying, for example Microsoft.Sql, must be registered at the subscription level:

## Private endpoint

This section lists the granular permissions required to deploy a private endpoint, manage [private endpoint subnet policies](../private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy.md), and deploy dependent resources

## Approval RBAC for private endpoint

Typically, a network administrator creates a private endpoint. Depending on your Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permissions, a private endpoint that you create is either *automatically approved* to send traffic to the API Management instance, or requires the resource owner to *manually approve* the connection.


|Approval method     |Minimum RBAC permissions  |
|---------|---------|
|Automatic     | `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/networkinterfaces/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/locations/availablePrivateEndpointTypes/read`<br/>`Microsoft.[ServiceProvider]/[resourceType]/privateEndpointConnectionsApproval/action`<br/>|
|Manual     | `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/networkinterfaces/**`<br/>`Microsoft.Network/locations/availablePrivateEndpointTypes/read`           |
