# Azure security baseline for Azure Private Link

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview) to Azure Private Link. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Private Link. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Private Link have been excluded. To see how Azure Private Link completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Virtual Network security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### 7.3: Maintain secure Azure resource configurations

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19025).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Resource Manager templates and Azure Policy to securely configure Azure resources associated with Private Link and related resources. Azure Resource Manager templates are JSON based files used to deploy Azure resources, any custom templates will need to be stored and maintained securely in a code repository. Use Azure policy [deny] and [deploy if not exist] to enforce secure settings across your Azure resources.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19027).

**Guidance**: Use Azure DevOps to securely store and manage your code like custom Azure policies, Azure Resource Manager templates and Desired State Configuration scripts. To access the resources you manage in Azure DevOps, you can grant or deny permissions to specific users, built-in security groups, or groups defined in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) if integrated with Azure DevOps, or Active Directory if integrated with TFS.

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19043).

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19044).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
