# Connect privately to a storage account using Azure Private Endpoint
Azure Private Endpoint is the fundamental building block for Private Link in Azure. It enables Azure resources, like virtual machines (VMs), to communicate privately with Private Link resources.

In this Quickstart, you will learn how to create a VM on an Azure virtual network, a storage account with a Private Endpoint using the Azure portal. Then, you can securely access the storage account from the VM.

> [!NOTE]
> Private endpoint(s) are not permitted in conjunction with service endpoints in the same subnet!

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

## Create a VM
In this section, you will create virtual network and the subnet to host the VM that is used to access your Private Link Resource (a storage account in this example).

### Create the virtual network

In this section, you will create virtual network and the subnet to host the VM that is used to access your Private Link resource.

1. On the upper-left side of the screen, select **Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Virtual network**.
1. In **Create virtual network**, enter or select this information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Name | Enter *MyVirtualNetwork*. |
    | Address space | Enter *10.1.0.0/16*. |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription.|

12. Select **Copy** on the connection string for key1.
 
## Connect to a VM from the internet

Connect to the VM *myVm* from the internet as follows:

1. In the portal's search bar, enter *myVm*.

1. Select the **Connect** button. After selecting the **Connect** button, **Connect to virtual machine** opens.

1. Select **Download RDP File**. Azure creates a Remote Desktop Protocol (*.rdp*) file and downloads it to your computer.

1. Open the *downloaded.rdp* file.

    1. If prompted, select **Connect**.

    1. Enter the username and password you specified when creating the VM.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You may need to select **More choices** > **Use a different account**, to specify the credentials you entered when you created the VM.

1. Select **OK**.

1. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. If you receive a certificate warning, select **Yes** or **Continue**.

1. Once the VM desktop appears, minimize it to go back to your local desktop.  

## Access storage account privately from the VM

In this section, you will connect privately to the storage account using the Private Endpoint.

1. In the Remote Desktop of *myVM*, open PowerShell.
2. Enter `nslookup mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net`
    You'll receive a message similar to this:
    ```azurepowershell
    Server:  UnKnown
    Address:  168.63.129.16
    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:    mystorageaccount123123.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
    Address:  10.0.0.5
    Aliases:  mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net
    ```
3. Install [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&tabs=windows).
4. Select **Storage accounts** with the right-click.
5. Select **Connect to an azure storage**.
6. Select **Use a connection string**.
7. Select **Next**.
8. Enter the connection string by pasting the information previously copied.
9. Select **Next**.
10. Select **Connect**.
11. Browse the Blob containers from mystorageaccount 
12. (Optionally) Create folders and/or upload files to *mystorageaccount*. 
13. Close the remote desktop connection to *myVM*. 

Additional options to access the storage account:
- Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer is a standalone free app from Microsoft that enables you to work visually with Azure storage data on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can install the application to browse privately the storage account content. 
 
- The AzCopy utility is another option for high-performance scriptable data transfer for Azure storage. Use AzCopy to transfer data to and from Blob, File, and Table storage. 


## Clean up resources 
When you're done using the Private Endpoint, storage account and the VM, delete the resource group and all of the resources it contains: 
1. Enter *myResourceGroup* in the **Search** box at the top of the portal and select *myResourceGroup* from the search results. 
2. Select **Delete resource group**. 
3. Enter *myResourceGroup* for **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** and select **Delete**. 

## Next steps
In this Quickstart, you created a VM on a virtual network and storage account and a Private Endpoint. You connected to one VM from the internet and securely communicated to the storage account using Private Link.
