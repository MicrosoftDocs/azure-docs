# Approve Private Link connections across subscriptions

Azure Private Link enables you to connect privately to Azure resources. Private Link connections are scoped to a specific subscription. This article shows you how to approve a private endpoint connection across subscriptions.

## Prerequisites

- Two active Azure subscriptions:
    
    - One subscription hosts the Azure resource and the other subscription contains the consumer private endpoint and virtual network.

- An administrator account for each subscription or an account with permissions in each subscription to create and manage resources.

Resources used in this article:

| Resource | Subscription | Resource group | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **storage1** *(This name is unique. Replace with the name you create.)* | subscription-1 | test-rg | East US 2 |
| **vnet-1** | subscription-2 | test-rg | East US 2 |
| **private-endpoint** | subscription-2 | test-rg | East US 2 |

## Sign in to subscription-1

Sign in to **subscription-1** in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Register the resource providers for subscription-1

For the private endpoint connection to complete successfully, the `Microsoft.Storage` and `Microsoft.Network` resource providers must be registered in **subscription-1**. Use the following steps to register the resource providers. If the `Microsoft.Storage` and `Microsoft.Network` resource providers are already registered, skip this step.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using a different resource type, you must register the resource provider for that resource type if it's not already registered.

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Subscription**. Select **Subscriptions** in the search results.

1. In **Settings**, select **Resource providers**.

1. In the **Resource providers** filter box, enter **Microsoft.Storage**. Select **Microsoft.Storage**.
