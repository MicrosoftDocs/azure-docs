# Azure role-based access control permissions required for Azure Network Security Perimeter usage

In this article, you learn about the Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permissions required to use [network security perimeter](./network-security-perimeter-concepts.md) capabilities. You learn about the actions required for network security perimeter, profile, network security perimeter access rule, diagnostic settings, association, and appendix capabilities.

## Azure role-based access control permissions

[Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview.md) enables you to assign only the specific actions to members of your organization that they require to complete their assigned responsibilities. To use network security perimeter  capabilities, the account you log into Azure with, must be assigned to the [Owner, Contributor, or Network contributor built-in roles](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md), or assigned to a [custom role](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md) that is assigned the actions listed for each network security perimeter  capability in the sections that follow. To learn how to check roles assigned to a user for a subscription, see [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal.yml). If you can't see the role assignments, contact the respective subscription admin.

### Network security perimeter access rule permissions

| Action | Description |
