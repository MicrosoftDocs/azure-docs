sections:
  - name: Private Link
    questions:
      - question: |
          What is Azure Private Endpoint and Azure Private Link Service?
        answer: |
          - **[Azure Private Endpoint](private-endpoint-overview.md)**: Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. You can use Private Endpoints to connect to an Azure PaaS service that supports Private Link or to your own Private Link Service.
          - **[Azure Private Link Service](private-link-service-overview.md)**: Azure Private Link service is a service created by a service provider. Currently, a Private Link service can be attached to the frontend IP configuration of a Standard Load Balancer. 
          
      - question: |
          How is traffic being sent when using Private Link?
        answer: |
          Traffic is sent privately using Microsoft backbone. It doesnâ€™t traverse the internet. Azure Private Link doesn't store customer data.

      - question: |
          What is the difference between Service Endpoints and Private Endpoints?
        answer: |
          - Private Endpoints grant network access to specific resources behind a given service providing granular segmentation. Traffic can reach the service resource from on premises without using public endpoints.
          - A Service Endpoint remains a publicly routable IP address. A Private Endpoint is a private IP in the address space of the virtual network where the private endpoint is configured.
          
      - question: |
          What is the relationship between Private Link Service and Private Endpoint?
        answer: |
          Multiple private link resource types support access via Private Endpoints. Resources include Azure PaaS services and your own Private Link Service. It's a one-to-many relationship. 
          
          A Private Link service receives connections from multiple Private Endpoints. A private endpoint connects to one Private Link Service.    
          
      - question: |
          Do I need to disable network policies for Private Link?
        answer: |
          Yes. Private Link Service need to disable network policies to function properly.
      
      - question: |
          Can I use for User-Defined Routes only, Network Security Groups only, or for both for Private EndPoint?
        answer: |
          Yes. To utilize policies like User-Defined Routes and Network Security Groups, you need to enable Network policies for a subnet in a virtual network for the Private Endpoint. This setting affects all the private endpoints within the subnet.

    questions:
      - question: |
          What is the right sequence of operations to set up service endpoints to an Azure service?
        answer: |
          There are two steps to secure an Azure service resource through service endpoints:

          1. Turn on service endpoints for the Azure service.
          1. Set up virtual network access control lists (ACLs) on the Azure service.

          The first step is a network-side operation, and the second step is a service resource-side operation. The same administrator or different administrators can perform the steps, based on the Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permissions granted to the administrator role.

          We recommend that you turn on service endpoints for your virtual network before you set up virtual network ACLs on the Azure service side. To set up virtual network service endpoints, you must perform the steps in the preceding sequence.

          >[!NOTE]
          > You must complete both of the preceding operations before you can limit the Azure service access to the allowed virtual network and subnet. Only turning on service endpoints for the Azure service on the network side does not give you the limited access. You must also set up virtual network ACLs on the Azure service side.

          Certain services (such as Azure SQL and Azure Cosmos DB) allow exceptions to the preceding sequence through the `IgnoreMissingVnetServiceEndpoint` flag. After you set the flag to `True`, you can set up virtual network ACLs on the Azure service side before turning on the service endpoints on the network side. Azure services provide this flag to help customers in cases where the specific IP firewalls are configured on Azure services.

          Turning on the service endpoints on the network side can lead to a connectivity drop, because the source IP changes from a public IPv4 address to a private address. Setting up virtual network ACLs on the Azure service side before turning on service endpoints on the network side can help avoid a connectivity drop.

          >[!NOTE]
          > If you enable Service Endpoint on certain services like "Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory" you can see IPV6 address connections on Sign-In Logs. Microsoft use an internal IPV6 private range for this type of connection.

      - question: |
          Do all Azure services reside in the Azure virtual network that the customer provides? How does a virtual network service endpoint work with Azure services?
        answer: |
          Not all Azure services reside in the customer's virtual network. Most Azure data services (such as Azure Storage, Azure SQL, and Azure Cosmos DB) are multitenant services that can be accessed over public IP addresses. For more information, see [Deploy dedicated Azure services into virtual networks](/azure/virtual-network/vnet-integration-for-azure-services).

          When you turn on virtual network service endpoints on the network side, and set up appropriate virtual network ACLs on the Azure service side, access to an Azure service is restricted to an allowed virtual network and subnet.

      - question: |
          How do virtual network service endpoints provide security?
        answer: |
          Virtual network service endpoints limit the Azure service's access to the allowed virtual network and subnet. In this way, they provide network-level security and isolation of the Azure service traffic.

          All traffic that uses virtual network service endpoints flows over the Microsoft backbone to provide another layer of isolation from the public internet. Customers can also choose to fully remove public internet access to the Azure service resources and allow traffic only from their virtual network through a combination of IP firewall and virtual network ACLs. Removing internet access helps protect the Azure service resources from unauthorized access.

      - question: |
          What does the virtual network service endpoint protect - virtual network resources or Azure service resources?
        answer: |
          Virtual network service endpoints help protect Azure service resources. Virtual network resources are protected through network security groups.

      - question: |
          Is there any cost for using virtual network service endpoints?
        answer: |
          No. There's no additional cost for using virtual network service endpoints.

      - question: |
          Can I turn on virtual network service endpoints and set up virtual network ACLs if the virtual network and the Azure service resources belong to different subscriptions?
        answer: |
          Yes, it's possible. Virtual networks and Azure service resources can be in the same subscription or in different subscriptions. The only requirement is that both the virtual network and the Azure service resources must be under the same Microsoft Entra tenant.

      - question: |
          Can I turn on virtual network service endpoints and set up virtual network ACLs if the virtual network and the Azure service resources belong to different Microsoft Entra tenants?
        answer: |
          Yes, it's possible when you're using service endpoints for Azure Storage and Azure Key Vault. For other services, virtual network service endpoints and virtual network ACLs are not supported across Microsoft Entra tenants.

      - question: |
          Can an on-premises device's IP address that's connected through an Azure virtual network gateway (VPN) or ExpressRoute gateway access Azure PaaS services over virtual network service endpoints?
        answer: |
          By default, Azure service resources secured to virtual networks are not reachable from on-premises networks. If you want to allow traffic from on-premises, you must also allow public (typically, NAT) IP addresses from on-premises or ExpressRoute. You can add these IP addresses through the IP firewall configuration for the Azure service resources.

          Alternatively, you can implement [private endpoints](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) for supported services.

      - question: |
          Can I use virtual network service endpoints to secure Azure services to multiple subnets within a virtual network or across multiple virtual networks?
        answer: |
          To secure Azure services to multiple subnets within a virtual network or across multiple virtual networks, enable service endpoints on the network side on each of the subnets independently. Then, secure Azure service resources to all of the subnets by setting up appropriate virtual network ACLs on the Azure service side.

      - question: |
          How can I filter outbound traffic from a virtual network to Azure services and still use service endpoints?
        answer: |
          If you want to inspect or filter the traffic destined to an Azure service from a virtual network, you can deploy a network virtual appliance within the virtual network. You can then apply service endpoints to the subnet where the network virtual appliance is deployed and secure Azure service resources only to this subnet through virtual network ACLs.

          This scenario might also be helpful if you want to restrict Azure service access from your virtual network only to specific Azure resources by using network virtual appliance filtering. For more information, see [Deploy highly available NVAs](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/nva-ha).

      - question: |
          What happens when someone accesses an Azure service account that has a virtual network ACL enabled from outside the virtual network?
        answer: |
          The service returns an HTTP 403 or HTTP 404 error.

      - question: |
          Are subnets of a virtual network created in different regions allowed to access an Azure service account in another region?
        answer: |
          Yes. For most of the Azure services, virtual networks created in different regions can access Azure services in another region through the virtual network service endpoints. For example, if an Azure Cosmos DB account is in the West US or East US region, and virtual networks are in multiple regions, the virtual networks can access Azure Cosmos DB.

          Azure SQL is an exception and is regional in nature. Both the virtual network and the Azure service need to be in the same region.

      - question: |
          Can an Azure service have both a virtual network ACL and an IP firewall?
        answer: |
          Yes. A virtual network ACL and an IP firewall can coexist. The features complement each other to help ensure isolation and security.

      - question: |
          What happens if you delete a virtual network or subnet that has service endpoints turned on for Azure services?
        answer: |
          Deletion of virtual networks and deletion of subnets are independent operations. They're supported even when you turn on service endpoints for Azure services.

          If you set up virtual network ACLs for Azure services, the ACL information associated with those Azure services is disabled when you delete a virtual network or subnet that has virtual network service endpoints turned on.

      - question: |
          What happens if I delete an Azure service account that has a virtual network service endpoint turned on?
        answer: |
          The deletion of an Azure service account is an independent operation. It's supported even if you turned on the service endpoint on the network side and set up virtual network ACLs on the Azure service side.

      - question: |
          What happens to the source IP address of a resource (like a VM in a subnet) that has virtual network service endpoints turned on?
        answer: |
          When you turn on virtual network service endpoints, the source IP addresses of the resources in your virtual network's subnet switch from using public IPv4 addresses to using the Azure virtual network's private IP addresses for traffic to Azure services. This switch can cause specific IP firewalls that are set to a public IPv4 address earlier on the Azure services to fail.

      - question: |
          Does the service endpoint route always take precedence?
        answer: |
          Service endpoints add a system route that takes precedence over Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes and provides optimum routing for the service endpoint traffic. Service endpoints always take service traffic directly from your virtual network to the service on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.

          For more information about how Azure selects a route, see [Virtual network traffic routing](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview).

      - question: |
          Do service endpoints work with ICMP?
        answer: |
          No. ICMP traffic that's sourced from a subnet with service endpoints enabled won't take the service tunnel path to the desired endpoint. Service endpoints handle only TCP traffic. If you want to test latency or connectivity to an endpoint via service endpoints, tools like ping and tracert won't show the true path that the resources within the subnet will take.

      - question: |
          How do NSGs on a subnet work with service endpoints?
        answer: |
          To reach the Azure service, NSGs need to allow outbound connectivity. If your NSGs are opened to all internet outbound traffic, the service endpoint traffic should work. You can also limit the outbound traffic to only service IP addresses by using the service tags.

      - question: |
          What permissions do I need to set up service endpoints?
        answer: |
          You can configure service endpoints on a virtual network independently if you have write access to that network.

          To secure Azure service resources to a virtual network, you must have **Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/joinViaServiceEndpoint/action** permission for the subnets that you're adding. This permission is included in the built-in service administrator role by default and can be modified through the creation of custom roles.

          For more information about built-in roles and assigning specific permissions to custom roles, see [Azure custom roles](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

      - question: |
          Can I filter virtual network traffic to Azure services over service endpoints?
        answer: |
          You can use virtual network service endpoint policies to filter virtual network traffic to Azure services, allowing only specific Azure service resources over the service endpoints. Endpoint policies provide granular access control from the virtual network traffic to the Azure services.

          To learn more, see [Virtual network service endpoint policies for Azure Storage](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoint-policies-overview).

      - question: |
          Does Microsoft Entra ID support virtual network service endpoints?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support service endpoints natively. For a complete list of Azure services that support virtual network service endpoints, see [Virtual network service endpoints](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview).

          In that list, the *Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory* tag listed under services that support service endpoints is used for supporting service endpoints to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1. [Virtual network integration for Data Lake Storage Gen1](../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-network-security.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) makes use of the virtual network service endpoint security between your virtual network and Microsoft Entra ID to generate additional security claims in the access token. These claims are then used to authenticate your virtual network to your Data Lake Storage Gen1 account and allow access.

      - question: |
          Are there any limits on how many service endpoints I can set up from my virtual network?
        answer: |
          There is no limit on the total number of service endpoints in a virtual network. For an Azure service resource (such as an Azure Storage account), services might enforce limits on the number of subnets that you use for securing the resource. The following table shows some example limits:

          | Azure service | Limits on virtual network rules |
          |---|---|
          | Azure Storage | 200 |
          | Azure SQL | 128 |
          | Azure Synapse Analytics | 128 |
          | Azure Key Vault | 200 |
          | Azure Cosmos DB | 64 |
          | Azure Event Hubs | 128 |
          | Azure Service Bus | 128 |

          >[!NOTE]
          > The limits are subject to change at the discretion of the Azure services. Refer to the respective service documentation for details.

      - question: |

        answer: |
          You can use virtual network service endpoint policies to filter virtual network traffic to Azure services, allowing only specific Azure service resources over the service endpoints. Endpoint policies provide granular access control from the virtual network traffic to the Azure services.

  - name: Private Endpoint
    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I create multiple Private Endpoints in same virtual network? Can they connect to different services? 
        answer: |
          Yes. You can have multiple Private Endpoints in same virtual network or subnet. They can connect to different services.  

      - question: |
           Can we link multiple private DNS zones with the same name? 
        answer: |
           No, creating multiple zones with the same name for a single virtual network isn't supported.  

      - question: |
          Do I require a dedicated subnet for Private Endpoints? 
        answer: |
          No. You don't require a dedicated subnet for Private Endpoints. You can choose a Private Endpoint IP from any subnet from the virtual network where your service is deployed.  

      - question: |
          Can a private endpoint connect to Private Link services across Microsoft Entra tenants? 
        answer: |
          Yes. Private endpoints can connect to Private Link services or to an Azure PaaS across Microsoft Entra tenants. Private Endpoints across tenants require a manual request approval. 

      - question: |
          Can Private Endpoint connect to Azure PaaS resources across Azure regions?
        answer: |
          Yes. Private Endpoints can connect to Azure PaaS resources across Azure regions.

      - question: |
          Can I modify my Private Endpoint Network Interface Card (NIC)?
        answer: |
          When a private endpoint is created, a read-only NIC is assigned. The NIC can't be modified and will remain for the life cycle of the Private endpoint.

      - question: |
          How do I achieve availability while using Private Endpoint if there are regional failures?
        answer: |
          Private Endpoints are highly available resources with an SLA as per [SLA for Azure Private Link](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/private-link/v1_0/). However, since they're regional resources, any Azure region outage can affect the availability. To achieve availability if there are regional failures, multiple PEs connected to same destination resource could be deployed in different regions. This way if one region goes down, you can still route the traffic for your recovery scenarios through PE in different region to access the destination resource. For info on how the regional failures are handled on destination service side, review the service documentation on failover and recovery. Private Link traffic follows the Azure DNS resolution for the destination endpoint.

      - question: |
          How do I achieve availability while using private endpoints if there's Availability Zone failures?
        answer: |
          Private Endpoints are highly available resources with an SLA as per [SLA for Azure Private Link](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/private-link/v1_0/). Private Endpoints are zone-agnostic: an availability zone failure in the region of the Private Endpoint won't affect the availability of the Private Endpoint.
      
      - question: |
          Do private endpoints support ICMP traffic?
        answer: |
          TCP and UDP traffic are only supported for a private endpoint. For more information, see [Private Link limitations](./private-link-service-overview.md#limitations).
          
  - name: Private Link Service
    questions:
      - question: |
          What are the prerequisites for creating a Private Link Service? 
        answer: |
          Your service backends should be in a Virtual Network and behind a Standard Load Balancer.

      - question: |
          How can I scale my Private Link service? 
        answer: |
          You can scale your Private Link Service in a few different ways: 
          - Add Backend VMs to the pool behind your Standard Load Balancer 
          - Add an IP to the Private Link Service. We allow up to 8 IPs per Private Link Service.
          - Add new Private Link Service to Standard Load Balancer. We allow up to eight Private Link Services per Standard Load Balancer.   
          
      - question: |
          What is the NAT (Network Address Translation) IP Configuration used in Private Link Service? How can I scale in terms of available ports and connections? 
        answer: |
          - The NAT IP configuration ensures the source (consumer) and destination (service provider) address space don't have IP conflicts. The configuration provides source NAT for the private link traffic for the destination. The NAT IP address shows up as source IP for all packets received by your service and destination IP for all packets sent by your service. NAT IP can be chosen from any subnet in a service provider's Virtual Network.
          - Each NAT IP provides 64k TCP connections (64k ports) per VM behind the Standard Load Balancer. In order to scale and add more connections, you can either add new NAT IPs or add more VMs behind the Standard Load Balancer. Doing so scales the port availability and allow for more connections. Connections are distributed across NAT IPs and VMs behind the Standard Load Balancer.
          
      - question: |
          Can I connect my service to multiple Private Endpoints?
        answer: |
          Yes. One Private Link Service can receive connections from multiple Private Endpoints. However one Private Endpoint can only connect to one Private Link Service.

      - question: |
          How should I control the exposure of my Private Link Service?
        answer: |
          You can control the exposure using the visibility configuration on Private Link service. Visibility supports three settings:
          
          - **None** - Only subscriptions with role based access can locate the service. 
          - **Restrictive** - Only subscriptions that are approved and with role based access can locate the service. 
          - **All** - Everyone can locate the service. 
           
      - question: |
          Can I create a Private Link service with Basic Load Balancer? 
        answer: |
          No. Private Link Service over a Basic Load Balancer isn't supported.

      - question: |
          Is a dedicated subnet required for Private Link Service? 
        answer: |
          No. A dedicated subnet isn't required for the Private Link Service. You can choose any subnet in your virtual network where your service is deployed.   

      - question: |
          I'm a service provider using Azure Private Link. Do I need to make sure all my customers have unique IP space and donâ€™t overlap with my IP space? 
        answer: |
          No. Azure Private Link provides this functionality for you. You aren't required to have nonoverlapping address space with your customer's address space.
