# Tutorial: Improve website response using Traffic Manager

This tutorial describes how to use Traffic Manager to create a highly responsive website by directing user traffic to the website with the lowest latency. Typically, the datacenter with the lowest latency is the one that is closest in geographic distance.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create two VMs running a basic website on IIS
> * Create two test VMs to view Traffic Manager in action
> * Configure DNS name for the VMs running IIS
> * Create a Traffic Manager profile for improved website performance
> * Add VM endpoints to the Traffic Manager profile
> * View Traffic Manager in action

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

In order to see the Traffic Manager in action, this tutorial requires that you deploy the following:

- Two instances of basic websites running in different Azure regions - **East US** and **West Europe**.
- Two test VMs for testing the Traffic Manager - one VM in **East US** and the second VM in **West Europe**. The test VMs are used to illustrate how Traffic Manager routes user traffic to the website that is running in the same region as it provides the lowest latency.

### Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

### Create websites

In this section, you create two website instances that provide the two service endpoints for the Traffic Manager profile in two Azure regions. Creating the two websites includes the following steps:

1. Create two VMs for running a basic website - one in **East US**, and the other in **West Europe**.
1. Install IIS server on each VM and update the default website page that describes the VM name that a user is connected to when visiting the website.

#### Create VMs for running websites

In this section, you create two VMs **myIISVMEastUS** and **myIISVMWestEurope** in the **East US** and **West Europe** Azure regions.

1. Enter *virtual machines* in the search.
1. Under **Services**, select **Virtual machines**.
1. In the **Virtual machines** page, select **Create** and then **Azure virtual machine**. The **Create a virtual machine** page opens.

## Test Traffic Manager profile

In this section, you test how the Traffic Manager routes user traffic to the nearest VMs running the website to provide minimum latency. To view the Traffic Manager in action, complete the following steps:

1. Determine the DNS name of your Traffic Manager profile.
1. View Traffic Manager in action as follows:
    - From the test VM (*myVMEastUS*) that is located in the **East US** region, in a web browser, browse to the DNS name of your Traffic Manager profile.
    - From the test VM (*myVMWestEurope*) that is located in the **West Europe** region, in a web browser, browse to the DNS name of your Traffic Manager profile.

### Determine DNS name of Traffic Manager profile

In this tutorial, for simplicity, you use the DNS name of the Traffic Manager profile to visit the websites.

You can determine the DNS name of the Traffic Manager profile as follows:

1. In the portal’s search bar, search for the **Traffic Manager profile** name that you created in the preceding section. In the results that are displayed, select the traffic manager profile.
1. Select **Overview**.
1. The **Traffic Manager profile** displays the DNS name of your newly created Traffic Manager profile. In production deployments, you configure a vanity domain name to point to the Traffic Manager domain name, using a DNS CNAME record.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-traffic-manager-improve-website-response/traffic-manager-dns-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Traffic Manager DNS name.":::

### View Traffic Manager in action

In this section, you can see the Traffic Manager is action.

1. Select **All resources** in the left-hand menu, and then from the resources list select **myVMEastUS** that is located in the *myResourceGroupTM1* resource group.
1. On the **Overview** page, select **Connect**, and select **Bastion**.
1. Type your authentication credentials. Then, select **Connect**.
1. In a web browser on the VM *myVMEastUS*, type the DNS name of your Traffic Manager profile to view your website. Since the VM located in **East US**, you're routed to the nearest website hosted on the nearest IIS server *myIISVMEastUS* that is located in **East US**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-traffic-manager-improve-website-response/eastus-traffic-manager-test.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Traffic Manager profile in a web browser for East US.":::

1. Next, connect to the VM *myVMWestEurope* located in **West Europe** using steps 1-5 and browse to the Traffic Manager profile domain name from this VM. Since the VM located in **West Europe**, you're now routed to the website hosted on nearest the IIS server *myIISVMWestEurope* that is located in **West Europe**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-traffic-manager-improve-website-response/westeurope-traffic-manager-test.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Traffic Manager profile in a web browser for West Europe.":::


## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources.

1. Enter the name of your resource group in the **Search** box at the top of the portal and select it from the search results.
1. At the top of the page for the resource group, select **Delete resource group**. 
1. A page will open warning you that you're about to delete resources. Type the name of the resource group and select **Delete** to finish deleting the resources and the resource group.
