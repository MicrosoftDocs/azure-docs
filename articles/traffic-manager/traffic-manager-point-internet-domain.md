# Point a company Internet domain to an Azure Traffic Manager domain

When you create a Traffic Manager profile, Azure automatically assigns a DNS name for that profile. To use a name from your DNS zone, create a CNAME DNS record that maps to the domain name of your Traffic Manager profile. You can find the Traffic Manager domain name in the **General** section on the Configuration page of the Traffic Manager profile.

For example, to point name `www.contoso.com` to the Traffic Manager DNS name `contoso.trafficmanager.net`, you create the following DNS resource record:

`www.contoso.com IN CNAME contoso.trafficmanager.net.`

All traffic requests to *www\.contoso.com* get directed to *contoso.trafficmanager.net*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot point a second-level domain, such as *contoso.com*, to the Traffic Manager domain. DNS protocol standards do not allow CNAME records for second-level domain names.
