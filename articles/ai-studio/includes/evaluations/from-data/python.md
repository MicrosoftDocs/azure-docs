To thoroughly assess the performance of your generative AI application when applied to a substantial dataset, you can evaluate in your development environment with the Azure AI SDK. Given either a test dataset or flow target, your generative AI application performance is quantitatively measured with both mathematical based metrics and AI-assisted metrics. This evaluation run provides you with comprehensive insights into the application's capabilities and limitations. 

In this article, you learn to create an evaluation run from a test dataset or flow with built-in evaluation metrics from Azure AI Studio SDK then view the results in Azure AI Studio if you choose to log it there. 

## Prerequisites

To evaluate with AI-assisted metrics, you need:

- A test dataset in `.jsonl` format. See the next section for dataset requirements
- A deployment of one of these models: GPT 3.5 models, GPT 4 models, or Davinci models.

## Supported scenarios and datasets

We currently offer support for these scenarios:

- **Question Answering**: This scenario is designed for applications that involve answering user queries and providing responses. 
- **Conversation**: This scenario is suitable for applications where the model engages in conversation using a retrieval-augmented approach to extract information from your provided documents and generate detailed responses. 

For more in-depth information on each metric definition and how it's calculated,see [Evaluation and monitoring metrics](../../../concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in.md).

| Scenario           | Default metrics                          | Performance and quality metrics                                   | Risk and safety metrics                                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Question Answering | Groundedness, Relevance, Coherence       | Groundedness, Relevance, Coherence, Fluency, Similarity, F1 Score | Hateful and unfair content, Sexual content, Violent content, Self-harm-related content |
| Conversation       | Groundedness, Relevance, Retrieval Score | Groundedness, Relevance, Coherence, Fluency, Retrieval Score      | Hateful and unfair content, Sexual content, Violent content, Self-harm-related content |

When using AI-assisted performance and quality metrics, you must specify a GPT model for the calculation process. Choose a deployment with either GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or the Davinci model for your calculations.

When using AI-assisted risk and safety metrics, you do not need to provide a connection and deployment. The Azure AI Studio safety evaluations back-end service provisions a GPT-4 model that can generate content risk severity scores and reasoning to enable you to evaluate your application for content harms. 

> [!NOTE]
> Currently AI-assisted risk and safety metrics are only available in the following regions: East US 2, France Central, UK South, Sweden Central. Groundedness measurement leveraging Azure AI Content Safety Groundedness Detection is only supported following regions: East US 2 and Sweden Central. Read more about the [supported metrics](../../../concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in.md) and when to use which metric.

### Supported input data format for question answering

We require question and answer pairs in `.jsonl` format with the required fields as follows:

| Metric         | Question      | Response      | Context       | Ground truth  |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Groundedness   | Required: Str | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           |
| Relevance      | Required: Str | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           |
| Coherence      | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           | N/A           |
| Fluency        | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           | N/A           |
| Similarity | N/A | Required: Str | N/A           | Required: Str |
| F1 Score | N/A  | Required: Str | N/A           | Required: Str |

- Question: the question asked by the user in Question Answer pair
- Response: the response to question generated by the model as answer
- Context: the source that response is generated with respect to (that is, grounding documents)
- Ground truth: the response to question generated by user/human as the true answer

An example of a question and answer pair with context and ground truth provided:

```json
{
  "question":"What is the capital of France?",
  "context":"France is in Europe",
  "answer":"Paris is the capital of France.",
  "ground_truth": "Paris"
}
```

### Supported input data format for conversation

We require a chat payload in the following `.jsonl` format, which is a list of conversation turns (within `"messages"`) in a conversation. 

Each conversation turn contains:
- `content`: The content of that turn of the conversation.
- `role`: Either the user or assistant.
- `"citations"` (within `"context"`): Provides the documents and its ID as key value pairs from the retrieval-augmented generation model. 

| Metric          | Citations from retrieved documents |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Groundedness    | Required: str       |
| Relevance       | Required: str       |
| Retrieval score | Required: str       |
| Coherence       | N/A       |
| Fluency         | N/A       |

**Citations**: the relevant source from retrieved documents by retrieval model or user provided context that model's response is generated with respect to.

```json
{
    "messages": [
        {
            "content": "<conversation_turn_content>", 
            "role": "<role_name>", 
            "context": {
                "citations": [
                    {
                        "id": "<content_key>",
                        "content": "<content_value>"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Evaluate with the Azure AI SDK

Built-in evaluation metrics are available with the following installation:

```python
pip install azure-ai-generative[evaluate]
```

Import default metrics with:

```python
from azure.ai.generative.evaluate import evaluate
```

For the supported scenarios mentioned previously, we provide default metrics by `task_type` as shown in the chart later in this article. The `evaluate()` function calculates a default set of metrics with option to override metrics with `metrics_list` which accepts metrics as string:

| Scenario task type   | `task_type` value  | Default metrics | All metrics |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Question Answering                                         | `qa`              | `gpt_groundedness` (requires context), `gpt_relevance` (requires context), `gpt_coherence` | `gpt_groundedness`, `gpt_relevance`, `gpt_coherence`, `gpt_fluency`, `gpt_similarity`, `f1_score`, `hate_unfairness`, `sexual`, `violence`, `self_harm` |
| Single and multi-turn conversation | `chat`            |  `gpt_groundedness`, `gpt_relevance`, `gpt_retrieval_score`                                 |`gpt_groundedness`, `gpt_relevance`, `gpt_retrieval_score`, `gpt_coherence`, `gpt_fluency`,`hate_unfairness`, `sexual`, `violence`, `self_harm`                                 |

### Set up your Azure OpenAI configurations for AI-assisted metrics

Before you call the `evaluate()` function, your environment needs to set up your large language model deployment configuration that's required for generating the AI-assisted metrics.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.resources.client import AIClient

client = AIClient.from_config(DefaultAzureCredential())
```
> [!NOTE]
> If only risk and safety metrics are passed into `metrics_list` then the `model_config` parameter in the following interface is optional. The Azure AI Studio safety evaluations back-end service provisions a GPT-4 model that can generate content risk severity scores and reasoning to enable you to evaluate your application for content harms.  

### Evaluate question answering: `qa`

#### Run a flow and evaluate

We provide an `evaluate` function call with the following interface for running a local flow and then evaluating the results. 

```python
result = evaluate( 
    evaluation_name="my-qa-eval-with-flow", #name your evaluation to view in AI Studio
    target=myflow, # pass in a flow that you want to run then evaluate results on 
    data=mydata, # data to be evaluated
    task_type="qa", # for different task types, different metrics are available
    metrics_list=["gpt_groundedness","gpt_relevance","gpt_coherence","gpt_fluency","gpt_similarity", "hate_unfairness", "sexual", "violence", "self_harm"] #optional superset over default set of metrics
    model_config= { #for AI-assisted metrics, need to hook up AOAI GPT model for doing the measurement
            "api_version": "2023-05-15",
            "api_base": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_BASE"),
            "api_type": "azure",
            "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            "deployment_id": os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENT")
    },
    data_mapping={
        "question":"question", #column of data providing input to model
        "context":"context", #column of data providing context for each input
        "ground_truth":"groundtruth" #column of data providing ground truth answer, optional for default metrics
        },
    output_path="./myevalresults", #optional: save output artifacts to local folder path 
    tracking_uri=client.tracking_uri #optional: if configured with AI client, evaluation gets logged to AI Studio
)
```

#### Evaluate on test dataset

Alternatively if you already have a test dataset and *don't need to run a flow* to get the generated results, you can alter the above function call to not take in a `target` parameter. However, if no `target` is specified, you must provide `"y_pred"` in your `data_mapping` parameter.

```python
result = evaluate( 
    evaluation_name="my-qa-eval-with-data", #name your evaluation to view in AI Studio
    data=mydata, # data to be evaluated
    task_type="qa", # for different task types, different metrics are available
    metrics_list=["gpt_groundedness","gpt_relevance","gpt_coherence","gpt_fluency","gpt_similarity", "hate_unfairness", "sexual", "violence", "self_harm"] #optional superset over default set of metrics
    model_config= { #for AI-assisted metrics, need to hook up AOAI GPT model for doing the measurement
            "api_version": "2023-05-15",
            "api_base": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_BASE"),
            "api_type": "azure",
            "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            "deployment_id": os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENT")
    },
    data_mapping={
        "question":"question", #column of data providing input to model
        "context":"context", #column of data providing context for each input
        "answer":"answer", #column of data providing output from model
        "ground_truth":"groundtruth" #column of data providing ground truth answer, optional for default metrics
        },
    output_path="./myevalresults", #optional: save evaluation results .jsonl to local folder path 
    tracking_uri=client.tracking_uri #optional: if configured with AI client, evaluation gets logged to AI Studio
)
```

#### Evaluating jailbreak vulnerability

Evaluating jailbreak is a comparative measurement, not an AI-assisted metric. Run evaluations on two different, red-teamed datasets: a baseline adversarial test dataset versus the same adversarial test dataset with jailbreak injections in the first turn. You can do this with functionality and attack datasets from the [adversarial simulator](../../../how-to/simulator-interaction-data.md). Then you can evaluate jailbreak vulnerability by comparing content risk evaluations between the two test dataset's content risk defect rates. 

#### Evaluation result 

The `evaluate()` function outputs an `EvaluationResult()` that includes a `metric_summary` and `artifacts`. `metric_summary` outputs a mean calculated summary of all metrics.

Here's an example output from `result.metric_summary`:
```json
{
  "mean_gpt_groundedness":4.8, "mean_gpt_relevance":3.7, "mean_gpt_coherence":4.1, "hate_unfairness_defect_rate":0.33, "sexual_defect_rate":0.12, "violence_defect_rate":0.0, "self_harm_defect_rate":0.0
}
```

The `artifacts` includes the name of the `.jsonl` file with metrics per data row logged as part as evaluation in AI Studio.

Here's an example output from `result.artifacts`:
```json
{
  "eval_results.jsonl": "runs:/8657dcb8-57b0-4ea5-9f8d-c040ebfa597f/eval_results.jsonl"
}
```

The contents of `eval_results.jsonl` looks like this: 
```json
{
  "question": "What is the capital of France?",
  "context": "France is in Europe",
  "answer": "Paris is the capital of France.",
  "ground_truth": "Paris",
  "gpt_groundedness": "5",
  "gpt_coherence": "5",
  "gpt_relevance": "5",
  "hate_unfairness_score": "0",
  "hate_unfairness": "Very low",
  "hate_unfairness_reasoning": "The system's response does not express any negative sentiment towards any protected factors, nor any unfrounded inference of sensitive attributes."
}
```

The outputs of your risk and safety metrics will provide the following:

- `{metric_name}_defect_rate`, which measures % of instances that surpassed the severity threshold (set to default 4) and is the aggregate metric over the whole dataset.
- `{metric_name}_score` with a range between 0 and 7 severity for each data point. You can read more about the descriptions of each [content risk and severity scale](../../../concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in.md).
- `{metric_name}_reasoning` with a text reasoning for why a certain severity score was given for each data point.

You can download your `EvaluationResult()` with `download_evaluation_artifacts()` to a local folder path. 

```python
result.download_evaluation_artifacts("./myevalresults")
```

> [!TIP]
> Get the contents of the `result.studio_url` property for a link to view your logged evaluation results in AI Studio.

### Evaluate Conversation: `chat`

The same interface can be used with `evaluate()` for the conversation scenario but with data mapping required only for model output `y_pred` and `task_type="chat"`.

```python
task_type="chat",
data_mapping={
        "y_pred":"messages", #key name of chat payload format that corresponds to each turn of the conversation if data with model generated output is provided without a target
        }
```

An example of an output with scores appended at the end:

```json

  "messages": [
    {
      "content": "will my compass work in patagonia",
      "role": "user",
