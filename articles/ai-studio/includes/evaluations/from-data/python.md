To thoroughly assess the performance of your generative AI application when applied to a substantial dataset, you can evaluate in your development environment with the Azure AI SDK. Given either a test dataset or flow target, your generative AI application performance is quantitatively measured with both mathematical based metrics and AI-assisted metrics. This evaluation run provides you with comprehensive insights into the application's capabilities and limitations. 

In this article, you learn to create an evaluation run from a test dataset or flow with built-in evaluation metrics from Azure AI Studio SDK then view the results in Azure AI Studio if you choose to log it there. 

## Prerequisites

To evaluate with AI-assisted metrics, you need:

+ A test dataset in `.jsonl` format. See the next section for dataset requirements
+ A deployment of one of these models: GPT 3.5 models, GPT 4 models, or Davinci models.

## Supported scenarios and datasets

We currently offer support for these scenarios: 
+ **Question Answering**: This scenario is designed for applications that involve answering user queries and providing responses. 
+ **Conversation**: This scenario is suitable for applications where the model engages in conversation using a retrieval-augmented approach to extract information from your provided documents and generate detailed responses. 

For more in-depth information on each metric definition and how it's calculated, learn more [here](https://aka.ms/azureaistudioevaluationmetrics).

| Scenario           | Default metrics                          | All metrics                                                                                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Question Answering | Groundedness, Relevance, Coherence       | Groundedness, Relevance, Coherence, Fluency, GPT Similarity, F1 Score, Exact Match, ADA Similarity |
| Conversation       | Groundedness, Relevance, Retrieval Score | Groundedness, Relevance, Retrieval Score                                                           |

When using AI-assisted metrics for evaluation, you must specify a GPT model for the calculation process. Choose a deployment with either GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or the Davinci model for your calculations. If you select ADA similarity, it requires an embedding model and you must also select a deployment featuring the `text-similarity-ada-001` or `text-similarity-ada-002` model to support ADA similarity calculations. 

### Supported input data format for question answering

We require question and answer pairs in `.jsonl` format with the required fields as follows:

| Metric         | Question      | Response      | Context       | Ground truth  |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Groundedness   | Required: Str | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           |
| Relevance      | Required: Str | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           |
| Coherence      | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           | N/A           |
| Fluency        | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           | N/A           |
| GPT-similarity | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           | Required: Str |
| F1 Score | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           | Required: Str |
| Exact Match | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           | Required: Str |
| ADA similarity | Required: Str | Required: Str | N/A           | Required: Str |

- Question: the question asked by the user in Question Answer pair
- Response: the response to question generated by the model as answer
- Context: the source that response is generated with respect to (that is, grounding documents)
- Ground truth: the response to question generated by user/human as the true answer

An example of a question and answer pair with context and ground truth provided:

```json
{
  "question":"What is the capital of France?",
  "context":"France is in Europe",
  "answer":"Paris is the capital of France.",
  "ground_truth": "Paris"
}
```

### Supported input data format for conversation

We require a chat payload in the following `.jsonl` format, which is a list of conversation turns (within `"messages"`) in a conversation. 

Each conversation turn contains:
- `content`: The content of that turn of the conversation.
- `role`: Either the user or assistant.
- `"citations"` (within `"context"`): Provides the documents and its ID as key value pairs from the retrieval-augmented generation model. 

> [!NOTE]
> Currently only metrics for conversations or chat payloads with `"citations"` field provided (RAG scenario) are supported.

| Metric          | Citations from retrieved documents |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Groundedness    | Required: str       |
| Relevance       | Required: str       |
| Retrieval score | Required: str       |

**Citations**: the relevant source from retrieved documents by retrieval model or user provided context that model's response is generated with respect to.

```json
{
    "messages": [
        {
            "content": "<conversation_turn_content>", 
            "role": "<role_name>", 
            "context": {
                "citations": [
                    {
                        "id": "<content_key>",
                        "content": "<content_value>"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```


## Evaluate with the Azure AI SDK

Built-in evaluation metrics are available with the following installation:

```python
pip install azure-ai-generative[evaluate]
```

Import default metrics with:

```python
from azure.ai.generative.evaluate import evaluate
```

For the supported scenarios mentioned previously, we provide default metrics by `task_type` as shown in the chart later in this article. The `evaluate()` function calculates a default set of metrics with option to override metrics with `metrics_list` which accepts metrics as string:

| Scenario task type   | `task_type` value  | Default metrics | All metrics |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Question Answering                                         | `qa`              | `gpt_groundedness` (requires context), `gpt_relevance` (requires context), `gpt_coherence` | `gpt_groundedness`, `gpt_relevance`, `gpt_coherence`, `gpt_fluency`, `gpt_similarity`, `f1_score`, `exact_match`, `ada_similarity` |
| Single and multi-turn conversation (context required) | `chat`            |  `gpt_groundedness`, `gpt_relevance`, `gpt_retrieval_score`                                 |`gpt_groundedness`, `gpt_relevance`, `gpt_retrieval_score`                                 |

### Set up your Azure Open AI configurations for AI-assisted metrics

Before you call the `evaluate()` function, your environment needs to set up your large language model deployment configuration that's required for generating the AI-assisted metrics. 

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.generative import AIClient

client = AIClient.from_config(DefaultAzureCredential())
```

### Evaluate question answering: `qa`

#### Run a flow and evaluate

We provide an `evaluate` function call with the following interface for running a local flow and then evaluating the results. 

```python
result = evaluate( 
    evaluation_name="my-qa-eval-with-flow", #name your evaluation to view in AI studio
    target=myflow, # pass in a flow that you want to run then evaluate results on 
    data=mydata, # data to be evaluated
    task_type="qa", # for different task types, different metrics are available
    metrics_list=["gpt_groundedness","gpt_relevance","gpt_coherence","gpt_fluency","gpt_similarity"] #optional superset over default set of metrics
    model_config= { #for AI-assisted metrics, need to hook up AOAI GPT model for doing the measurement
            "api_version": "2023-05-15",
            "api_base": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_BASE"),
            "api_type": "azure",
            "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            "deployment_id": os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENT")
    },
    data_mapping={
        "questions":"question", #column of data providing input to model
        "contexts":"context", #column of data providing context for each input
        "y_test":"groundtruth" #column of data providing ground truth answer, optional for default metrics
        },
    output_path="./myevalresults", #optional: save output artifacts to local folder path 
    tracking=client.tracking_uri #optional: if configured with AI client, evaluation gets logged to AI Studio
)
```

#### Evaluate on test dataset
Alternatively if you already have a test dataset and *don't need to run a flow* to get the generated results, you can alter the above function call to not take in a `target` parameter. However, if no `target` is specified, you must provide `"y_pred"` in your `data_mapping` parameter.

```python
result = evaluate( 
    evaluation_name="my-qa-eval-with-data", #name your evaluation to view in AI studio
    data=mydata, # data to be evaluated
    task_type="qa", # for different task types, different metrics are available
    metrics_list=["gpt_groundedness","gpt_relevance","gpt_coherence","gpt_fluency","gpt_similarity"] #optional superset over default set of metrics
    model_config= { #for AI-assisted metrics, need to hook up AOAI GPT model for doing the measurement
            "api_version": "2023-05-15",
            "api_base": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_BASE"),
            "api_type": "azure",
            "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            "deployment_id": os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENT")
    },
    data_mapping={
        "questions":"question", #column of data providing input to model
        "contexts":"context", #column of data providing context for each input
        "y_pred":"answer", #column of data providing output from model
        "y_test":"groundtruth" #column of data providing ground truth answer, optional for default metrics
        },
    output_path="./myevalresults", #optional: save evaluation results .jsonl to local folder path 
    tracking=client.tracking_uri #optional: if configured with AI client, evaluation gets logged to AI Studio
)
```
#### Evaluation result 
`Evaluate()` outputs an `EvaluationResult()` that includes a `metric_summary` and `artifacts`.

```json
metric_summary = {"mean_gpt_groundedness":4.8, "mean_gpt_relevance":3.7, "mean_gpt_coherence":4.1}
metric_artifacts =
{"question":"What is the capital of France?",
"context":"France is in Europe",
"answer":"Paris is the capital of France.",
"ground_truth": "Paris",
"gpt_groundedness":"5","gpt_coherence":"5","gpt_relevance":"5"}
```
You can download your `EvaluationResult()` with the following
```python
result.download_evaluation_artifacts("./myevalresults")
```
### Evaluate Conversation: `chat`
The same interface can be used with `evaluate()` for the conversation scenario but with data mapping required only for model output `y_pred` and `task_type="chat"` shown below
```python
task_type="chat",
data_mapping={
        "y_pred":"messages", #key name of chat payload format that corresponds to each turn of the conversation if data with model generated output is provided without a target
        }
```

An example of an output: 
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "content": "will my compass work in patagonia",
      "role": "user",
      "context": {
